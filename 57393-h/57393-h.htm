<h2>
PUBLISHERS' NOTE
</h2>

<p>
Aside from the use Thoreau himself made of his Journal
in writing his more formal works, the first extensive
publication of the Journal material began in 1881 with
"Early Spring in Massachusetts." This volume consisted
of extracts covering the month of March and parts of
February and April, arranged according to the days of
the month, the entries for the successive years following
one another under each day. It was edited by Thoreau's
friend Mr. H. G. O. Blake, to whom the Journal was
bequeathed by Miss Sophia Thoreau, who died in 1876.
It was succeeded in 1884 by a volume entitled "Summer,"
which in reality covered only the early summer,
and that, in turn, by "Winter" in 1887 and "Autumn"
in 1892, all made by Mr. Blake on the same principle.
These volumes, from the first to the last, were received
with delight by the ever-increasing body of Thoreau's
admirers, but they have served to whet rather than satisfy
the appetite of readers, and it has long been evident
that they ought not to stand alone as representing this
important phase of Thoreau's activity. The publishers
therefore gladly seized the opportunity afforded, when
the Journal, on the death of Mr. Blake, passed into the
hands of Mr. E. H. Russell of Worcester, who was
desirous of giving it to the public in its entirety, and they
at once made arrangements with him to bring it out in
extenso as soon as the long labor of copying and comparing
the manuscripts could be completed. As editor
the publishers have been so fortunate as to secure
Mr. Bradford Torrey, who is eminently qualified to
consider Thoreau both as a writer and as an observer
of nature.
</p>

<h2>
EDITOR'S PREFACE
</h2>

<p>
Concerning this first practically complete printing of
Thoreau's Journal it seems proper to make the following
explanations, in addition to those contained in the
Publishers' Note:—
</p>

<p>
1. It has been found necessary, if the Journal was to
be of comfortable use by ordinary readers, to punctuate
it throughout. Otherwise each reader would have been
compelled to do the work for himself. A literal reproduction,
like the literal reproduction of Milton's minor
poems, for example, may some day be of interest to
antiquaries and special students; but such an edition
could never be adapted, more than the literal reproduction
of Milton's manuscripts, to the needs of those who
read for pleasure and general profit.
</p>

<p>
2. Certain things have been omitted; <i>i. e.</i>, incomplete
sentences, where parts of pages have been torn out by
the writer; long quotations, especially from Latin authors,
entered without comment, as in a commonplace-book;
Maine woods matter—"Chesuncook" and
"The Allegash and East Branch"—already printed <i>in
extenso</i> in the volume entitled "The Maine Woods;" a
few long lists of plants, etc., recapitulating matter contained
in the preceding pages; the word <i>ultimo</i>, or <i>ult.</i>,
which in hundreds of instances is written where the
context makes it plain that <i>instant</i> was the word intended;
a proper name here and there, out of regard
for the feelings of possible relatives or descendants of
the persons mentioned; guesses at the identification of
particular plants,—willows, goldenrods, and the like,—often
accompanied by tediously minute technical
descriptions, the whole evidently meant as mere memoranda
for the writer's possible future guidance, and
believed to be of no interest now, even to the botanical
reader.
</p>

<p>
3. In the case of passages which Thoreau had revised,
mostly in pencil, the editor has commonly printed the
original form when the amended one has been followed
in already printed volumes. In other cases the amended
version has been given. Corrections of error have always
been allowed to stand, except that, where it is plain
that the correction must have been made at a date later
than that of the original entry, the correction has been
printed as a footnote, without brackets.
</p>

<p>
4. The footnotes of the editor are always in brackets.
</p>

<p>
5. Where parts of the Journal have been printed in
the author's books, the editor and his associate, as far
as their knowledge has gone, have indicated the fact,
citing first the present and then the Riverside edition,—thus:
"<i>Week</i>, p. 305; Riv. 379." References to
"Channing" are to "Thoreau, the Poet-Naturalist,"
by William Ellery Channing, new edition, edited by
Mr. F. B. Sanborn. References to "Sanborn" are to
"Henry D. Thoreau," by F. B. Sanborn, in the American
Men of Letters.
</p>

<p>
6. The earlier manuscript volumes of the Journal, as
we now have them, are evidently not the originals, but
are made up of selections from volumes that appear to
have been destroyed by the author.
</p>

<p>
It remains only to add the editor's very hearty acknowledgements
to his associate, Mr. Francis H. Allen,
who has overseen and verified the copying of the manuscript,
an onerous task, and in every way, by counsel
and labor, has facilitated, not to say made possible, the
completion of the work.

<h2>
INTRODUCTION
</h2>

<p>
Thoreau was a man of his own kind. Many things
may be said of him, favorable and unfavorable, but
this must surely be said first,—that, taken for all in all,
he was like nobody else. Taken for all in all, be it remarked.
Other men have despised common sense; other
men have chosen to be poor, and, as between physical
comfort and better things, have made light of physical
comfort; other men, whether to their credit or discredit,
have held and expressed a contemptuous opinion
of their neighbors and all their neighbors' doings;
others, a smaller number, believing in an absolute goodness
and in a wisdom transcending human knowledge,
have distrusted the world as evil, accounting its influence
degrading, its prudence no better than cowardice,
its wisdom a kind of folly, its morality a compromise,
its religion a bargain, its possessions a defilement and a
hindrance, and so judging of the world, have striven at all
cost to live above it and apart. And some, no doubt, have
loved Nature as a mistress, fleeing to her from less congenial
company, and devoting a lifetime to the observation
and enjoyment of her ways. In no one of these
particulars was the hermit of Walden without forerunners;
but taken for all that he was, poet, idealist, stoic,
cynic, naturalist, spiritualist, lover of purity, seeker of
perfection, panegyrist of friendship and dweller in a
hermitage, freethinker and saint, where shall we look to
find his fellow? It seems but the plainest statement of
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_xix" name="Page_xix" href="#Page_xix">xix</a></span>
fact to say that, as there was none before him, so there is
scanty prospect of any to come after him.
</p>

<p>
His profession was literature; as to that there is no
sign that he was ever in doubt; and he understood from
the first that for a writing man nothing could take the
place of practice, partly because that is the one means of
acquiring ease of expression, and partly because a man
often has no suspicion of his own thoughts until his pen
discovers them; and almost from the first—a friend
(Emerson or another) having given him the hint—he
had come to feel that no practice is better or readier than
the keeping of a journal, a daily record of things thought,
seen, and felt. Such a record he began soon after leaving
college, and (being one of a thousand in this respect as in
others) he continued it to the end. By good fortune he
left it behind him, and, to complete the good fortune, it
is at last printed, no longer in selections, but as a whole;
and if a man is curious to know what such an original,
plain-spoken, perfection-seeking, convention-despising,
dogma-disbelieving, wisdom-loving, sham-hating, Nature-worshipping,
poverty-proud genius was in the habit
of confiding to so patient a listener at the close of the
day, he has only to read the book.
</p>

<p>
The man himself is there. Something of him, indeed,
is to be discovered, one half imagines, in the outward
aspect of the thirty-nine manuscript volumes: ordinary
"blank-books" of the sort furnished by country shopkeepers
fifty or sixty years ago, larger or smaller as might
happen, and of varying shapes (a customer seeking such
wares must not be too particular; one remembers
Thoreau's complaint that the universal preoccupation
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_xx" name="Page_xx" href="#Page_xx">xx</a></span>
with questions of money rendered it difficult for him to
find a blank-book that was not ruled for dollars and
cents), still neatly packed in the strong wooden box
which their owner, a workman needing not to be
ashamed, made with his own hands on purpose to hold
them.
</p>

<p>
A pretty full result of a short life they seem to be, as
one takes up volume after volume (the largest are found
to contain about a hundred thousand words) and turns
the leaves: the handwriting strong and rapid, leaning
well forward in its haste, none too legible, slow reading
at the best, with here and there a word that is almost
past making out; the orthography that of a naturally
good speller setting down his thoughts at full speed and
leaving his mistakes behind him; and the punctuation,
to call it such, no better than a makeshift,—after the
model of Sterne's, if one chooses to say so: a spattering
of dashes, and little else.<a name='FA_1' id='FA_1' href='#FN_1' class='fnanchor'>[1]</a>
</p>

<p>
As for the matter, it is more carefully considered, less
strictly improvised, than is customary with diarists. It is
evident, in fact, from references here and there, that
many of the entries were copied from an earlier pencilled
draft, made presumably in the field, "with the eye on the
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_xxi" name="Page_xxi" href="#Page_xxi">xxi</a></span>
object," while the work as a whole has been more or less
carefully revised, with erasures, emendations, and suggested
alternative readings.
</p>

<p>
As we have said, if a man wishes to know Thoreau as
he was, let him read the book. One thing he may be
sure of: he will find himself in clean, self-respecting
company, with no call to blush, as if he were playing
the eavesdropper. Of confessions, indeed, in the spicy
sense of the word, Thoreau had none to make. He was
no Montaigne, no Rousseau, no Samuel Pepys. How
should he be? He was a Puritan of Massachusetts,
though he kept no Sabbath, was seen in no church,—being
very different from Mr. Pepys in more ways than
one,—and esteemed the Hebrew scriptures as a good
book like any other. Once, indeed, when he was thirty-four
years old, he went to a "party." For anything we
know, that (with a little sowing of wild oats in the matter
of smoking dried lily-stems when a boy) was as near as
he ever came to dissipation. And he did not like it. "It
is a bad place to go to," he says,—"thirty or forty persons,
mostly young women, in a small room, warm and
noisy." One of the young women was reputed to be
"pretty-looking;" but he scarcely looked at her, though
he was "introduced," and he could not hear what she
said, because there was "such a clacking." "I could
imagine better places for conversation," he goes on,
"where there should be a certain degree of silence surrounding
you, and less than forty talking at once. Why,
this afternoon, even, I did better. There was old Mr.
Joseph Hosmer and I ate our luncheon of cracker and
cheese together in the woods. I heard all he said, though
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_xxii" name="Page_xxii" href="#Page_xxii">xxii</a></span>
it was not much, to be sure, and he could hear me. And
then he talked out of such a glorious repose, taking a
leisurely bite at the cracker and cheese between his
words; and so some of him was communicated to me,
and some of me to him, I trust."
</p>

<p>
He entertains a shrewd suspicion that assemblies of
this kind are got up with a view to matrimonial alliances
among the young people! For his part, at all events, he
doesn't understand "the use of going to see people
whom yet you never see, and who never see you." Some
of his friends make a singular blunder. They go out
of their way to talk to pretty young women <i>as such</i>.
Their prettiness may be a reason for looking at them, so
much he will concede,—for the sake of the antithesis,
if for nothing else,—but why is it any reason for
talking to them? For himself, though he may be "lacking
a sense in this respect," he derives "no pleasure
from talking with a young woman half an hour simply
because she has regular features."
</p>

<p>
How crabbed is divine philosophy! After this we are
not surprised when he concludes by saying: "The
society of young women is the most unprofitable I have
ever tried." No, no; he was nothing like Mr. Samuel
Pepys.
</p>

<p>
The sect of young women, we may add, need not feel
deeply affronted by this ungallant mention. It is perhaps
the only one of its kind in the journal (by its nature
restricted to matters interesting to the author), while
there are multitudes of passages to prove that Thoreau's
aversion to the society of older people taken as they run,
men and women alike, was hardly less pronounced. In
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_xxiii" name="Page_xxiii" href="#Page_xxiii">xxiii</a></span>
truth (and it is nothing of necessity against him), he was
not made for "parties," nor for clubs, nor even for general
companionship. "I am all without and in sight,"
said Montaigne, "born for society and friendship." So
was not Thoreau. He was all within, born for contemplation
and solitude. And what we are born for, that
let us be,—and so the will of God be done. Such, for
good or ill, was Thoreau's philosophy. "We are constantly
invited to be what we are," he said. It is one
of his memorable sentences; an admirable summary of
Emerson's essay on Self-Reliance.
</p>

<p>
His fellow mortals, as a rule, did not recommend
themselves to him. His thoughts were none the better
for their company, as they almost always were for the
company of the pine tree and the meadow. Inspiration,
a refreshing of the spiritual faculties, as indispensable to
him as daily bread, that his fellow mortals did not furnish
him. For this state of things he sometimes (once or
twice at least) mildly reproaches himself. It may be that
he is to blame for so commonly skipping humanity and
its affairs; he will seek to amend the fault, he promises.
But even at such a moment of exceptional humility, his
pen, reversing Balaam's rôle, runs into left-handed compliments
that are worse, if anything, than the original
offense. Hear him: "I will not avoid to go by where
those men are repairing the stone bridge. I will see if I
cannot see poetry in that, if that will not yield me a
reflection. It is narrow to be confined to woods and fields
and grand aspects of nature only.... Why not see
men standing in the sun and casting a shadow, even as
trees?... I will try to enjoy them as animals, at least."
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_xxiv" name="Page_xxiv" href="#Page_xxiv">xxiv</a></span>
</p>

<p>
This is in 1851. A year afterward we find him concerned
with the same theme, but in a less hesitating
mood. Now he is on his high horse, with apologies to
nobody. "It appears to me," he begins, "that to one
standing on the heights of philosophy mankind and the
works of man will have sunk out of sight altogether."
Man, in his opinion, is "too much insisted upon. The
poet says, 'The proper study of mankind is man.' I
say, Study to forget all that. Take wider views of the
universe.... What is the village, city, state, nation,
aye, the civilized world, that it should concern a man so
much? The thought of them affects me, in my wisest
hours, as when I pass a woodchuck's hole."
</p>

<p>
A high horse, indeed! But his comparison is really by
no means so disparaging as it sounds; for Thoreau took
a deep and lasting interest in woodchucks. At one time
and another he wrote many good pages about them;
for their reappearance in the spring he watched as for
the return of a friend, and once, at least, he devoted an
hour to digging out a burrow and recording with painstaking
minuteness the course and length of its ramifications.
A novelist, describing his heroine's boudoir, could
hardly have been more strict with himself. In fact, to
have said that one of Thoreau's human neighbors was
as interesting to him as a woodchuck would have been
to pay that neighbor a rather handsome compliment.
None of the brute animals, so called,—we have it on
his own authority,—ever vexed his ears with pomposity
or nonsense.
</p>

<p>
But we have interrupted his discourse midway. "I do
not value any view of the universe into which man and
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_xxv" name="Page_xxv" href="#Page_xxv">xxv</a></span>
the institutions of man enter very largely," he continues....
"Man is a past phenomenon to philosophy."
Then he descends a little to particulars. "Some rarely
go outdoors, most are always at home at night,"—Concord
people being uncommonly well brought up, it
would appear,—"very few indeed have stayed out all
night once in their lives; fewer still have gone behind the
world of humanity and seen its institutions like toadstools
by the wayside."
</p>

<p>
And then, having, with this good bit of philosophical
"tall talk," brushed aside humanity as a very little thing,
he proceeds to chronicle the really essential facts of the
day: that he landed that afternoon on Tall's Island, and
to his disappointment found the weather not cold or
windy enough for the meadow to make "its most serious
impression;" also, that the staddles from which the hay
had been removed were found to stand a foot or two
above the water; besides which, he saw cranberries on
the bottom (although he forgot to mention them in their
proper place), and noticed that the steam of the engine
looked very white that morning against the hillside.
</p>

<p>
All which setting of ordinary valuations topsy-turvy,
the lords of creation below the beasts that perish, may
lead an innocent reader to exclaim with one of old,
"Lord, what is man, that thou art mindful of him? and
the son of man, that thou visitest him?"
</p>

<p>
Nevertheless, we must not treat the matter too lightly,
easily as it lends itself to persiflage. Even in this extreme
instance it is not to be assumed that Thoreau was talking
for the sake of talking, or merely keeping his hand
in with his favorite rhetorical weapon, a paradox. That
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_xxvi" name="Page_xxvi" href="#Page_xxvi">xxvi</a></span>
desiderated "serious impression," at all events, was no
laughing matter; rather it was to have been the chief
event of the day; of more account to Thoreau than dinner
and supper both were likely to be to his farmer
neighbor. As for the woodchuck, its comparative rank
in the scale of animal existence, be it higher or lower,
is nothing to the purpose. For Thoreau it was simple
truth that, on some days, and in some states of mind,
he found the society of such a cave-dweller more acceptable,
or less unacceptable, than that of any number
of his highly civilized townsmen. Nor is the
statement one to be nervously concerned about. Any
inveterate stroller, the most matter-of-fact man alive
(though matter-of-fact men are not apt to be strollers),
might say the same, in all soberness, with no thought
of writing himself down a misanthrope, or of setting
himself up as a philosopher.
</p>

<p>
For one thing, the woodchuck is sure to be less intrusive,
less distracting, than the ordinary human specimen;
he fits in better with solitude and the solitary feeling.
He is never in the way. Moreover, you can say to a
woodchuck anything that comes into your head, without
fear of giving offense; a less important consideration
than the other, no doubt, woodchucks as a class not being
remarkably conversable, but still worthy of mention.
For, naturally enough, an outspoken freethinker like
Thoreau found the greater number of men not so very
different from "ministers," of whom he said, in a tone
of innocent surprise, that they "could not bear all kinds
of opinions,"—"as if any sincere thought were not the
best sort of truth!"
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_xxvii" name="Page_xxvii" href="#Page_xxvii">xxvii</a></span>
</p>
<p>
He walked one afternoon with Alcott, and spent an
agreeable hour, though for the most part he preferred
having the woods and fields to himself. Alcott was an
ineffectual genius, he remarks, "forever feeling about
vainly in his speech, and touching nothing" (one thinks
of Arnold's characterization of Shelley as a "beautiful
and ineffectual angel, beating in the void his luminous
wings in vain," which, in its turn, may call to mind
Lowell's comparison of Shelley's genius to a St. Elmo's
fire, "playing in ineffectual flame about the points of
his thought"), but after all, he was good company; not
quite so good as none, of course, but on the whole, as
men go, rather better than most. At least, he would
listen to what you had to offer. He was open-minded;
he wasn't shut up in a creed; an honest man's thought
would not shock him. You could talk to him without
running up against "some institution." In a word,—though
Thoreau doesn't say it,—he was something
like a woodchuck.
</p>

<p>
With all his passion for "that glorious society called
solitude," and with all his feeling that mankind, as a
"past phenomenon," thought far too highly of itself, it
is abundantly in evidence that Thoreau, in his own time
and on his own terms, was capable of a really human
delight in familiar intercourse with his fellows. Channing,
who should have known, speaks, a little vaguely,
to be sure, of his "fine social qualities." "Always a
genial and hospitable entertainer," he calls him. And
Mr. Ricketson, who also should have known, assures us
that "no man could hold a finer relationship with his
family than he." But of this aspect of his character,
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_xxviii" name="Page_xxviii" href="#Page_xxviii">xxviii</a></span>
it must be acknowledged, there is comparatively little
in the journal. What is very constant and emphatic
there—emphatic sometimes to the point of painfulness—is
the hermit's hunger and thirst after friendship;
a friendship the sweets of which, so far as appears, he
was very sparingly to enjoy. For if he was at home in
the family group and in huckleberry excursions with
children, if he relished to the full a talk with a stray fisherman,
a racy-tongued woodchopper, or a good Indian,
something very different seems to have been habitual
with him when it came to intercourse with equals and
friends.
</p>

<p>
Here, even more than elsewhere, he was an uncompromising
idealist. His craving was for a friendship
more than human, friendship such as it was beyond any
one about him to furnish, if it was not, as may fairly be
suspected, beyond his own capacity to receive. In respect
to outward things, his wealth, he truly said, was to want
little. In respect to friendship, his poverty was to want
the unattainable. It might have been retorted upon him
in his own words, that he was like a man who should
complain of hard times because he could not afford to
buy himself a crown. But the retort would perhaps have
been rather smart than fair. He, at least, would never
have acquiesced in it. He confided to his journal again
and again that he asked nothing of his friends but honesty,
sincerity, a grain of real appreciation, "an opportunity
once in a year to speak the truth;" but in the
end it came always to this, that he insisted upon perfection,
and, not finding it, went on his way hungry. Probably
it is true—one seems to divine a reason for it—that
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_xxix" name="Page_xxix" href="#Page_xxix">xxix</a></span>
idealists, claimers of the absolute, have commonly
found their fellow men a disappointment.
</p>

<p>
In Thoreau's case it was his best friends who most
severely tried his patience. They invite him to see them,
he complains, and then "do not show themselves." He
"pines and starves near them." All is useless. They
treat him so that he "feels a thousand miles off." "I
leave my friends early. I go away to cherish my idea of
friendship." Surely there is no sentence in all Thoreau's
books that is more thoroughly characteristic than that.
And how neatly it is turned! Listen also to this, which is
equally bitter, and almost equally perfect in the phrasing:
"No fields are so barren to me as the men of whom
I expect everything, but get nothing. In their neighborhood
I experience a painful yearning for society."
</p>

<p>
It is all a mystery to him. "How happens it," he
exclaims, "that I find myself making such an enormous
demand on men, and so constantly disappointed? Are
my friends aware how disappointed I am? Is it all my
fault? Am I incapable of expansion and generosity? I
shall accuse myself of anything else sooner." And again
he goes away sorrowful, consoling himself, as best he
can, with his own paradox,—
</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<p>"I might have loved him, had I loved him less."</p>
</div></div></div>

<p>
Strange that he should have suffered in this way,
many will think, with Emerson himself for a friend and
neighbor! Well, the two men were friends, but neither
was in this relation quite impeccable (which is as much
as to say that both were human), and to judge by such
hints as are gatherable on either side, their case was not
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_xxx" name="Page_xxx" href="#Page_xxx">xxx</a></span>
entirely unlike that of Bridget Elia and her cousin,—"generally
in harmony, with occasional bickerings, as it
should be among near relations;" though "bickerings"
is no doubt an undignified term for use in this connection.
It is interesting, some may deem it amusing, to put
side by side the statements of the two men upon this very
point; Emerson's communicated to the public shortly
after his friend's death, Thoreau's intrusted nine years
before to the privacy of his journal.
</p>

<p>
Emerson's speech is the more guarded, as, for more
reasons than one, it might have been expected to be.
His friend, he confesses, "was somewhat military in his
nature ... always manly and able, but rarely tender,
as if he did not feel himself except in opposition. He
wanted a fallacy to expose, a blunder to pillory, I may
say required a little sense of victory, a roll of the drum,
to call his powers into full exercise.... It seemed as if
his first instinct on hearing a proposition was to controvert
it, so impatient was he of the limitations of our daily
thought. This habit, of course, is a little chilling to the
social affections; and though the companion would in
the end acquit him of any malice or untruth, yet it mars
conversation. Hence no equal companion stood in
affectionate relations with one so pure and guileless."
</p>

<p>
Thoreau's entry is dated May 24, 1853. "Talked, or
tried to talk, with R. W. E. Lost my time, nay, almost
my identity. He, assuming a false opposition where
there was no difference of opinion, talked to the wind,
told me what I knew, and I lost my time trying to
imagine myself somebody else to oppose him."
</p>

<p>
It is the very same picture, drawn by another pencil,
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_xxxi" name="Page_xxxi" href="#Page_xxxi">xxxi</a></span>
with a different placing of the shadows; and since the
two sketches were made so many years apart and yet
seem to be descriptive of the same thing, it is perhaps fair
to conclude that this particular interview, which appears
to have degenerated into something like a dispute about
nothing (a very frequent subject of disputes, by the way),
was not exceptional, but rather typical. Without doubt
this was one of the occasions when Thoreau felt himself
treated as if he were "a thousand miles off," and went
home early to "cherish his idea of friendship." Let us
hope that he lost nothing else along with his time and
identity.
</p>

<p>
But here, again, we are in danger of an unseasonable
lightness. Friendship, according to Thoreau's apprehension
of it, was a thing infinitely sacred. A <i>friend</i>
might move him to petulance, as the best of friends
sometimes will; but <i>friendship</i>, the ideal state shown to
him in dreams, for speech concerning that there was
nowhere in English, nor anywhere else, a word sufficiently
noble and unsoiled. And even his friends he
loved, although, tongue-tied New-Englander that he
was, he could never tell them so. He loved them best
(and this, likewise, was no singularity) when they were
farthest away. In company, even in their company, he
could never utter his truest thought. So it is with us all.
It was a greater than Thoreau who said, "We descend
to meet;" and a greater still, perhaps (and he also a
Concord man), who confessed at fifty odd: "I doubt
whether I have ever really talked with half a dozen persons
in my life."
</p>

<p>
As for Thoreau, he knew at times, and owned as much
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_xxxii" name="Page_xxxii" href="#Page_xxxii">xxxii</a></span>
to himself, that his absorption in nature tended to unfit
him for human society. But so it was; he loved to be
alone. And in this respect he had no thought of change,—no
thought nor wish. Whatever happened, he would
still belong to no club but the true "country club," which
dined "at the sign of the Shrub Oak." The fields and
the woods, the old road, the river, and the pond, these
were his real neighbors. Year in and year out, how near
they were to him!—a nearness unspeakable; till sometimes
it seemed as if their being and his were not two,
but one and the same. With them was no frivolity, no
vulgarity, no changeableness, no prejudice. With them
he had no misunderstandings, no meaningless disputes,
no disappointments. They knew him, and were known
of him. In their society he felt himself renewed. There
he lived, and loved his life. There, if anywhere, the Spirit
of the Lord came upon him. Hear him, on a cool morning
in August, with the wind in the branches and the
crickets in the grass, and think of him, if you can, as
a being too cold for friendship!
</p>

<p>
"My heart leaps out of my mouth at the sound of the
wind in the woods. I, whose life was but yesterday so
desultory and shallow, suddenly recover my spirits, my
spirituality, through my hearing.... Ah! if I could
so live that there should be no desultory moments ...
I would walk, I would sit and sleep, with natural piety.
What if I could pray aloud, or to myself, as I went
along by the brookside, a cheerful prayer, like the birds!
For joy I could embrace the earth. I shall delight to be
buried in it. And then, to think of those I love among
men, who will know that I love them, though I tell them
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_xxxiii" name="Page_xxxiii" href="#Page_xxxiii">xxxiii</a></span>
not.... I thank you, God. I do not deserve anything;
I am unworthy of the least regard; and yet the world is
gilded for my delight, and holidays are prepared for me,
and my path is strewn with flowers.... O keep my
senses pure!"
</p>

<p>
Highly characteristic is that concluding ejaculation.
For Thoreau the five senses were not organs or means of
sensuous gratification, but the five gateways of the soul.
He would have them open and undefiled. Upon that
point no man was ever more insistent. Above all, no
sense must be pampered; else it would lose its native
freshness and delicacy, and so its diviner use. That way
lay perdition. When a woman came to Concord to lecture,
and Thoreau carried her manuscript to the hall
for her, wrapped in its owner's handkerchief, he complained
twenty-four hours afterward that his pocket
"still exhaled cologne." Faint, elusive outdoor odors
were not only a continual delight to him, but a positive
means of grace.
</p>

<p>
So, too, he would rather not see any of the scenic
wonders of the world. Only let his sense of beauty remain
uncorrupted, and he could trust his Musketaquid
meadows, and the low hills round about, to feed and
satisfy him forever.
</p>

<p>
Because of his jealousy in this regard, partly,—and
partly from ignorance, it may be, just as some of his
respectable village acquaintances would have found the
Iliad, of which he talked so much, duller than death in
comparison with the works of Mr. Sylvanus Cobb,—he
often spoke in slighting terms of operas and all the more
elaborate forms of music. The ear, he thought, if it
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_xxxiv" name="Page_xxxiv" href="#Page_xxxiv">xxxiv</a></span>
were kept innocent, would find satisfaction in the very
simplest of musical sounds. For himself, there was no
language extravagant enough to express his rapturous
delight in them. Now "all the romance of his youthfulest
moment" came flooding back upon him, and
anon he was carried away till he "looked under the lids
of Time,"—all by the humming of telegraph-wires or,
at night especially, by the distant baying of a hound.
</p>

<p>
To the modern "musical person" certain of his confessions
under this head are of a character to excite
mirth. He is "much indebted," for instance, to a neighbor
"who will now and then, in the intervals of his
work, draw forth a few strains from his accordion."
The neighbor is only a learner, but, says Thoreau, "I
find when his strains cease that I have been elevated."
His daily philosophy is all of a piece, one perceives:
plain fare, plain clothes, plain company, a hut in the
woods, an old book,—and for inspiration the notes of
a neighbor's accordion.
</p>

<p>
More than once, too, he acknowledges his obligation
to that famous rural entertainer and civilizer, the hand-organ.
"All Vienna" could not do more for him, he
ventures to think. "It is perhaps the best instrumental
music that we have," he observes; which can hardly
have been true, even in Concord, one prefers to believe,
while admitting the possibility. If it is heard far enough
away, he goes on, so that the creaking of the machinery
is lost, "it serves the grandest use for me,—it deepens
my existence."
</p>

<p>
We smile, of course, as in duty bound, at so artless an
avowal; but, having smiled, we are bound also to render
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_xxxv" name="Page_xxxv" href="#Page_xxxv">xxxv</a></span>
our opinion that the most <i>blasé</i> concert-goer, if he be a
man of native sensibility, will readily enough discern
what Thoreau has in mind, and with equal readiness
will concede to it a measure of reasonableness; for he
will have the witness in himself that the effect of music
upon the soul depends as much upon the temper of the
soul as upon the perfection of the instrument. One day
a simple air, simply sung or played, will land him in
heaven; and another day the best efforts of the full
symphony orchestra will leave him in the mire. And
after all, it is possibly better, albeit in "poorer taste," to
be transported by the wheezing of an accordion than
to be bored by finer music. As for Thoreau, he studied
to be a master of the art of living; and in the practice of
that art, as of any other, it is the glory of the artist to
achieve extraordinary results by ordinary means. To
have one's existence deepened—there cannot be many
things more desirable than that; and as between our
unsophisticated recluse and the average "musical person"
aforesaid, the case is perhaps not so one-sided as at
first sight it looks; or, if it be, the odds are possibly not
always on the side of what seems the greater opportunity.
</p>

<p>
His life, the quality of his life, that for Thoreau was
the paramount concern. To the furthering of that end
all things must be held subservient. Nature, man, books,
music, all for him had the same use. This one thing he
did,—he cultivated himself. If any, because of his so
doing, accused him of selfishness, preaching to him of
philanthropy, almsgiving, and what not, his answer was
already in his mouth. Mankind, he was prepared to
maintain, was very well off without such helps, which
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_xxxvi" name="Page_xxxvi" href="#Page_xxxvi">xxxvi</a></span>
oftener than not did as much harm as good (though the
concrete case at his elbow—half-clad Johnny Riordan,
a fugitive slave, an Irishman who wished to bring his
family over—appealed to him as quickly as to most,
one is glad to notice); and, however that might be, the
world needed a thousand times more than any so-called
charity the sight of a man here and there living for
higher ends than the world itself knows of. His own
course, at any rate, was clear before him: "What I am,
I am, and say not. Being is the great explainer."
</p>

<p>
His life, his <i>own</i> life, that he must live; and he must
be in earnest about it. He was no indifferent, no little-carer,
no skeptic, as if truth and a lie were but varying
shades of the same color, and virtue, according to the
old phrase, "a mean between vices." You would never
catch him sighing, "Oh, well!" or "Who knows?"
Qualifications, reconciliations, <i>rapprochements</i>, the two
sides of the shield, and all that,—these were considerations
not in his line. Before everything else he was a
believer,—an idealist, that is,—the last person in the
world to put up with half-truths or half-way measures.
If "existing things" were thus and so, that was no reason
why, with the sect of the Sadducees, he should make
the best of them. What if there <i>were</i> no best of them?
What if they were all bad? And anyhow, why not begin
new? It was conceivable, was it not, that a man should
set his own example, and follow his own copy. General
opinion,—what was that? Was a thing better established
because ten thousand fools believed it? Did folly
become wisdom by being raised to a higher power? And
antiquity, tradition,—what were they? Could a blind
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_xxxvii" name="Page_xxxvii" href="#Page_xxxvii">xxxvii</a></span>
man of fifteen centuries ago see farther than a blind man
of the present time? And if the blind led the blind, then
or now, would not both fall into the ditch?
</p>

<p>
Yes, he was undoubtedly peculiar. As to that there
could never be anything but agreement among practical
people. In a world where shiftiness and hesitation are
the rule, nothing looks so eccentric as a straight course.
It must be acknowledged, too, that a man whose goodness
has a strong infusion of the bitter, and whose opinions
turn out of the way for nobody, is not apt to be the
most comfortable kind of neighbor. We were not greatly
surprised, lately, to hear an excellent lady remark of
Thoreau that, from all she had read about him, she
thought he must have been "a very disagreeable gentleman."
It could hardly be said of him, as Mr. Birrell
says of Matthew Arnold, who was himself a pretty serious
person, and, after a way of his own, a preacher of
righteousness, that he "conspired and contrived to make
things pleasant."
</p>

<p>
Being a consistent idealist, he was of course an
extremist, falling in that respect little behind the man
out of Nazareth, whose hard sayings, by all accounts,
were sometimes less acceptable than they might have
been, and of whom Thoreau asserted, in his emphatic
way, that if his words were really read from any pulpit
in the land, "there would not be left one stone of that
meeting-house upon another." Thoreau worshipped
purity, and the every-day ethical standards of the street
were to him an abomination. "There are certain current
expressions and blasphemous moods of viewing things,"
he declares, "as when we say 'he is doing a good business,'
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_xxxviii" name="Page_xxxviii" href="#Page_xxxviii">xxxviii</a></span>
more profane than cursing and swearing. There is
death and sin in such words. Let not the children hear
them." That innocent-sounding phrase about "a good
business"—as if a business might be taken for granted
as good because it brought in money—was as abhorrent
to him as the outrageous worldly philosophy of an
old castaway like Major Pendennis is to the ordinarily
sensitive reader.
</p>

<p>
He was constitutionally earnest. There are pages of
the journal, indeed, which make one feel that perhaps
he was in danger of being too much so for his own profit.
Possibly it is not quite wholesome, possibly, if one dares
to say it, it begets a something like priggishness, for the
soul to be keyed up continually to so strenuous a pitch.
In Thoreau's case, at all events, one is glad for every
sign of a slackening of the tension. "Set the red hen
to-day;" "Got green grapes to stew;" "Painted the
bottom of my boat;" trivialities like these, too far apart
(one is tempted to colloquialize, and call them "precious
few," finding them so infrequent and so welcome), strike
the reader with a sudden sensation of relief, as if he had
been wading to the chin, and all at once his feet had
touched a shallow.
</p>

<p>
So, too, one is thankful to come upon a really amusing
dissertation about the tying of shoe-strings, or rather
about their too easy untying; a matter with which, it
appears, Thoreau had for years experienced "a great
deal of trouble." His walking companion (Channing,
presumably) and himself had often compared notes
about it, concluding after experiments that the duration
of a shoe-tie might be made to serve as a reasonably
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_xxxix" name="Page_xxxix" href="#Page_xxxix">xxxix</a></span>
accurate unit of measure, as accurate, say, as a stadium
or a league. Channing, indeed, would sometimes go
without shoe-strings, rather than be plagued so incessantly
by their dissolute behavior. Finally Thoreau,
being then thirty-six years old, and always exceptionally
clever with his hands, set his wits seriously at work upon
knots, and by a stroke of good fortune (or a stroke of
genius) hit upon one which answered his end; only to be
told, on communicating his discovery to a third party,
that he had all his life been tying "granny knots," never
having learned, at school or elsewhere, the secret of a
square one! It might be well, he concludes, if all children
were "taught the accomplishment." Verily, as
Hosea Biglow did not say, they didn't know everything
down in Concord.
</p>

<p>
More refreshing still are entries describing hours of
serene communion with nature, hours in which, as in an
instance already cited, the Spirit of the Lord blessed him,
and he forgot even to be good. These entries, likewise,
are less numerous than could be wished, though perhaps
as frequent as could fairly be expected; since ecstasies,
like feasts, must in the nature of things be somewhat
broadly spaced; and it is interesting, not to say surprising,
to see how frankly he looks upon them afterward as
subjects on which to try his pen. In these "seasons when
our genius reigns we may be powerless for expression,"
he remarks; but in calmer hours, when talent is again
active, "the memory of those rarer moods comes to color
our picture, and is the permanent paint-pot, as it were,
into which we dip our brush." But, in truth, the whole
journal, some volumes of which are carefully indexed
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_xl" name="Page_xl" href="#Page_xl">[xl]</a></span>
in his own hand, is quite undisguisedly a collection of
thoughts, feelings, and observations, out of which copy
is to be extracted. In it, he says, "I wish to set down
such choice experiences that my own writings may inspire
me, and at last I may make wholes of parts.... Each
thought that is welcomed and recorded is a nest-egg by
the side of which more will be laid."
</p>

<p>
A born writer, he is "greedy of occasions to express"
himself. He counts it "wise to write on many subjects,
that so he may find the right and inspiring one." "There
are innumerable avenues to a perception of the truth," he
tells himself. "Improve the suggestion of each object,
however humble, however slight and transient the provocation.
What else is there to be improved?"
</p>

<p>
The literary diarist, like the husbandman, knows not
which shall prosper. Morning and evening, he can only
sow the seed. So it was with Thoreau. "A strange and
unaccountable thing," he pronounces his journal. "It
will allow nothing to be predicated of it; its good is not
good, nor its bad bad. If I make a huge effort to expose
my innermost and richest wares to light, my counter
seems cluttered with the meanest homemade stuffs; but
after months or years I may discover the wealth of India,
and whatever rarity is brought overland from Cathay, in
that confused heap, and what seemed a festoon of dried
apple or pumpkin will prove a string of Brazilian diamonds,
or pearls from Coromandel."
</p>

<p>
Well, we make sure that whoever tumbles the heap
over now, more than forty years after the last object was
laid upon it, will be rewarded with many and many a
jewel. Here, for his encouragement, are half a dozen
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_xli" name="Page_xli" href="#Page_xli">[xli]</a></span>
out of the goodly number that one customer has lately
turned up, in a hasty rummaging of the counter:—
</p>

<p>
"When a dog runs at you, whistle for him."
</p>

<p>
"We must be at the helm at least once a day; we must
feel the tiller rope in our hands, and know that if we sail,
we steer."
</p>

<p>
"In composition I miss the hue of the mind."
</p>

<p>
"After the era of youth is past, the knowledge of ourselves
is an alloy that spoils our satisfactions."
</p>

<p>
"How vain it is to sit down to write when you have
not stood up to live."
</p>

<p>
"Silence is of various depths and fertility, like soil."
</p>

<p>
"Praise should be spoken as simply and naturally as
a flower emits its fragrance."
</p>

<p>
Here, again, is a mere nothing, a momentary impression
caught, in ball-players' language, on the fly; nothing
like a pearl from Coromandel, if you will, but at
the worst a toothsome bite out of a wild New England
apple. It is winter. "I saw a team come out of a path
in the woods," says Thoreau, "as though it had never
gone in, but belonged there, and only came out like
Elisha's bears." There will be few country-bred Yankee
boys, we imagine, who will not remember to have experienced
something precisely like that, under precisely
the same circumstances, though it never occurred to
them to put the feeling into words, much less to preserve
it in a drop of ink. That is one of the good things
that a writer does for us. And our country-bred boy, if
we mistake not, is likely to consider this one careless
sentence of Thoreau, which adds not a cent's worth
to the sum of what is called human knowledge, as of
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_xlii" name="Page_xlii" href="#Page_xlii">[xlii]</a></span>
more value than any dozen pages of his painstaking
botanical records.
</p>

<p>
Thoreau the naturalist appears in the journal, not as a
master, but as a learner. It could hardly be otherwise,
of course, a journal being what it is. There we see him
conning by himself his daily lesson, correcting yesterday
by to-day, and to-day by to-morrow, progressing, like
every scholar, over the stepping-stones of his own mistakes.
Of the branches he pursued, as far as the present
writer can presume to judge, he was strongest in
botany; certainly it was to plants that he most persistently
devoted himself; but even there he had as many
uncertainties as discoveries to set down; and he set them
down with unflagging zeal and unrestrained particularity.
The daily account is running over with question-marks.
His patience was admirable; the more so as he
worked entirely by himself, with few of the helps that in
this better-furnished time almost belie the old proverb,
and make even the beginner's path a kind of royal road
to learning. The day of "How-to-Know" handbooks
had not yet dawned.
</p>

<p>
Of his bird-studies it would be interesting, if there
were room, to speak at greater length. Here, even more
than in botany, if that were possible, he suffered for lack
of assistance, and even in his later entries leaves the
present-day reader wondering how so eager a scholar
could have spent so many years in learning so comparatively
little. The mystery is partly cleared, however,
when it is found that until 1854—say for more than a
dozen years—he studied without a glass. He does not
buy things, he explains, with characteristic self-satisfaction,
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_xliii" name="Page_xliii" href="#Page_xliii">[xliii]</a></span>
till long after he begins to want them, so that when
he does get them he is "prepared to make a perfect use
of them." It was wasteful economy. He might as well
have botanized without a pocket-lens.
</p>

<p>
But glass or no glass, how could an ornithological
observer, whose power—so Emerson said—"seemed
to indicate additional senses," be in the field daily for
ten or fifteen years before setting eyes upon his first rose-breasted
grosbeak?—which memorable event happened
to Thoreau on the 13th of June, 1853! How could
a man who had made it his business for at least a dozen
years to "name all the birds without a gun," stand for a
long time within a few feet of a large bird, so busy that
it could not be scared far away, and then go home uncertain
whether he had been looking at a woodcock or
a snipe? How could he, when thirty-five years old, see a
flock of sparrows, and hear them sing, and not be sure
whether or not they were chipping sparrows? And how
could a man so strong in times and seasons, always
marking dates with an almanac's exactness, how could
he, so late as '52, inquire concerning the downy woodpecker,
one of the more familiar and constant of year-round
birds, "Do we see him in the winter?" and again,
a year later, be found asking whether he, the same
downy woodpecker, is not the first of our woodland birds
to arrive in the spring? At thirty-six he is amazed to the
extent of double exclamation points by the sight of a
flicker so early as March 29.
</p>

<p>
It fills one with astonishment to hear him (May 4,
1853) describing what he takes to be an indigo-bird after
this fashion: "Dark throat and light beneath, and white
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_xliv" name="Page_xliv" href="#Page_xliv">[xliv]</a></span>
spot on wings," with hoarse, rapid notes, a kind of <i>twee,
twee, twee,</i> not musical. The stranger may have been—most
likely it was—a black-throated blue warbler;
which is as much like an indigo-bird as a bluebird is like
a blue jay,—or a yellow apple like an orange. And the
indigo-bird, it should be said, is a common New-Englander,
such as one of our modern schoolboy bird-gazers
would have no difficulty in getting into his "list" any
summer day in Concord; while the warbler in question,
though nothing but a migrant, and somewhat seclusive
in its habits, is so regular in its passage and so unmistakably
marked (no bird more so), that it seems marvellous
how Thoreau, prowling about everywhere with his
eyes open, should year after year have missed it.
</p>

<p>
The truth appears to be that even of the commoner
sorts of birds that breed in eastern Massachusetts or
migrate through it, Thoreau—during the greater part
of his life, at least—knew by sight and name only a
small proportion, wonderful as his knowledge seemed to
those who, like Emerson, knew practically nothing.<a name='FA_2' id='FA_2' href='#FN_2' class='fnanchor'>[2]</a>
</p>

<p>
Not that the journal is likely to prove less interesting
to bird-loving readers on this account. On the contrary,
it may rather be more so, as showing them the means
and methods of an ornithological amateur fifty years
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_xlv" name="Page_xlv" href="#Page_xlv">[xlv]</a></span>
ago, and, especially, as providing for them a desirable
store of ornithological nuts to crack on winter evenings.
Some such reader, by a careful collation of the data
which the publication of the journal as a whole puts at
his disposal, will perhaps succeed in settling the identity
of the famous "night-warbler;" a bird which some, we
believe, have suspected to be nothing rarer than the
almost superabundant oven-bird, but which, so far as
we ourselves know, may have been almost any one (or
any two or three) of our smaller common birds that are
given to occasional ecstatic song-flights.<a name='FA_3' id='FA_3' href='#FN_3' class='fnanchor'>[3]</a> Whatever it
was, it was of use to Thoreau for the quickening of his
imagination, and for literary purposes; and Emerson
was well advised in warning him to beware of booking
it, lest life henceforth should have so much the less to
show him.
</p>

<p>
It must be said, however, that Thoreau stood in slight
need of such a caution. He cherished for himself a pretty
favorable opinion of a certain kind and measure of
ignorance. With regard to some of his ornithological
mysteries, for example,—the night-warbler, the seringo-bird
(which with something like certainty we may conjecture
to have been the savanna sparrow), and others,—he
flatters himself that his good genius had withheld
their names from him that he might the better learn their
character,—whatever such an expression may be supposed
to mean.
</p>

<p>
He maintained stoutly, from beginning to end, that
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_xlvi" name="Page_xlvi" href="#Page_xlvi">[xlvi]</a></span>
he was not of the ordinary school of naturalists, but "a
mystic, a transcendentalist, and a natural philosopher
in one;" though he believed himself, in his own words,
"by constitution as good an observer as most." He will
not be one of those who seek facts as facts, studying
nature as a dead language. He studies her for purposes
of his own, in search of the "raw material of tropes and
figures." "I pray for such experience as will make nature
significant," he declares; and then, with the same
penful of ink, he asks: "Is that the swamp gooseberry
of Gray now just beginning to blossom at Saw-Mill
Brook? It has a divided style and stamens, etc., as yet
not longer than the calyx, though my slip has no thorns
nor prickles," and so on, and so on. Pages on pages of
the journal are choke-full, literally, of this kind of botanical
interrogation, till the unsympathetic reader will be
in danger of surmising that the mystical searcher after
tropes and symbols is sometimes not so utterly unlike the
student of the dead language of fact. But then, it is one
of the virtues of a journal that it is not a work of art, that
it has no form, no fashion (and so does not go out of
fashion), and is always at liberty to contradict itself. As
Thoreau said, he tumbled his goods upon the counter;
no single customer is bound to be pleased with them all;
different men, different tastes; let each select from the
pile the things that suit his fancy.
</p>

<p>
For our own part, we acknowledge,—and the shrewd
reader may already have remarked the fact,—we have
not been disinclined to choose here and there a bit of
some less rare and costly stuff. The man is so sternly
virtuous, so inexorably in earnest, so heart-set upon perfection,
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_xlvii" name="Page_xlvii" href="#Page_xlvii">[xlvii]</a></span>
that we almost like him best when for a moment
he betrays something that suggests a touch of human
frailty. We prick up our ears when he speaks of a woman
he once in a while goes to see, who tells him to his
face that she thinks him self-conceited. Now, then, we
whisper to ourselves, how will this man who despises
flattery, and, boasting himself a "commoner," professes
that for him "there is something devilish in manners,"—how
will this candor-loving, truth-speaking, truth-appreciating
man enjoy the rebuke of so unmannered
a mentor? And we smile and say Aha! when he adds
that the lady wonders why he does not visit her oftener.
</p>

<p>
We smile, too, when he brags, in early February, that
he has not yet put on his winter clothing, amusing himself
the while over the muffs and furs of his less hardy
neighbors, his own "simple diet" making him so tough
in the fibre that he "flourishes like a tree;" and then, a
week later, writes with unbroken equanimity that he is
down with bronchitis, contenting himself to spend his
days cuddled in a warm corner by the stove.
</p>

<p>
Trifles of this kind encourage a pleasant feeling of
brotherly relationship. He is one of us, after all, with
like passions. But of course we really like him best when
he is at his best,—as in some outpouring of his love for
things natural and wild. Let us have one more such
quotation: "Now I yearn for one of those old, meandering,
dry, uninhabited roads, which lead away from
towns, which lead us away from temptation, which conduct
us to the outside of earth, over its uppermost crust;
where you may forget in what country you are travelling;
where your head is more in heaven than your feet are on
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_xlviii" name="Page_xlviii" href="#Page_xlviii">[xlviii]</a></span>
earth; where you can pace when your breast is full, and
cherish your moodiness.... There I can walk and
recover the lost child that I am without any ringing of a
bell."
</p>

<p>
For real warmth, when once the fire burns, who can
exceed our stoic?
</p>

<p>
We like, also, his bits of prettiness, things in which
he is second to nobody, though prettiness, again, is not
supposed to be the stoic's "note;" and they are all the
prettier, as well as ten times more welcome, because he
has the grace—and the sound literary sense—to drop
them here and there, as it were casually, upon a ground
of simple, unaffected prose. Here, now, is a sentence
that by itself is worth a deal of ornithology: "The song
sparrow is heard in fields and pastures, setting the midsummer
day to music,—as if it were the music of a
mossy rail or fence-post." Of dragon-flies he says:
"How lavishly they are painted! How cheap was the
paint! How free was the fancy of their Creator!" In
early June, when woods are putting forth leaves, "the
summer is pitching its tent." He finds the dainty fringed
polygala (whose ordinary color is a lovely rose-purple)
sporting white blossoms, and remarks: "Thus many
flowers have their nun sisters, dressed in white." Soaring
hawks are "kites without strings;" and when he and his
companion are travelling across country, keeping out of
the sight of houses, yet compelled to traverse here and
there a farmer's field, they "shut every window with an
apple tree."
</p>

<p>
Gems like these one need not be a connoisseur to
appreciate, and they are common upon his counter. It
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_xlix" name="Page_xlix" href="#Page_xlix">[xlix]</a></span>
was a good name that Channing gave him: "The Poet-Naturalist."
</p>

<p>
But there are better things than flowers and jewels to
be found in Thoreau's stock. There are cordials and
tonics there, to brace a man when he is weary; eye-washes,
to cleanse his vision till he sees the heights above
him and repents the lowness of his aims and the vulgarity
of his satisfactions; blisters and irritant plasters
in large variety and of warranted strength; but little or
nothing, so far as the present customer has noticed, in the
line of anodynes and sleeping-powders. There we may
buy moral wisdom, which is not only the "foundation
and source of good writing," as one of the ancients said,
but of the arts in general, especially the art of life. If
the world is too much with us, if wealth attracts and the
"rust of copper" has begun to eat into the soul, if we are
in danger of selling our years for things that perish with
the using, here we may find correctives, and go away
thankful, rejoicing henceforth to be rich in a better
coinage than any that bears the world's stamp. The
very exaggerations of the master—if we call them such—may
do us good like a medicine; for there are diseased
conditions which yield to nothing so quickly as to
a shock.
</p>

<p>
As for Thoreau himself, life might have been smoother
for him had he been less exacting in his idealism, more
tolerant of imperfection in others and in himself; had
he taken his studies, and even his spiritual aspirations, a
grain or two less seriously. A bit of boyish play now and
then, the bow quite unbent, or a dose of novel-reading of
the love-making, humanizing (Trollopean) sort, could
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_l" name="Page_l" href="#Page_l">[l]</a></span>
one imagine it, with a more temperate cherishing of his
moodiness, might have done him no harm. It would
have been for his comfort, so much may confidently be
said, whether for his happiness is another question, had
he been one of those gentler humorists who can sometimes
see themselves, as all humorists have the gift of
seeing other people, funny side out. But then, had these
things been so, had his natural scope been wider, his
genius, so to say, more tropical, richer, freer, more expansive,
more various and flexible, more like the spreading
banyan and less like the soaring, sky-pointing
spruce,—why, then he would no longer have been
Thoreau; for better or worse, his speech would have lost
its distinctive tang; and in the long run the world, which
likes a touch of bitter and a touch of sour, would almost
certainly have found the man himself less interesting,
and his books less rememberable. And made as he was,
"born to his own affairs," what else could he do but
stick to himself? "We are constantly invited to be what
we are," he said. The words might fittingly have been
cut upon his gravestone.

<p class="p2 center">
SOLITUDE
</p>

<p>
To be alone I find it necessary to escape the present,—I
avoid myself. How could I be alone in the Roman
emperor's chamber of mirrors? I seek a garret. The
spiders must not be disturbed, nor the floor swept, nor
the lumber arranged.

THE MOULD OUR DEEDS LEAVE
</p>

<p>
<i>Oct. 24.</i> Every part of nature teaches that the passing
away of one life is the making room for another. The
oak dies down to the ground, leaving within its rind
a rich virgin mould, which will impart a vigorous life
to an infant forest. The pine leaves a sandy and sterile
soil, the harder woods a strong and fruitful mould.
</p>

<p>
So this constant abrasion and decay makes the soil
of my future growth. As I live now so shall I reap. If
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_4" name="Page_4" href="#Page_4">4</a></span>
I grow pines and birches, my virgin mould will not
sustain the oak; but pines and birches, or, perchance,
weeds and brambles, will constitute my second growth.<a name='FA_4' id='FA_4' href='#FN_4' class='fnanchor'>[4]</a>

SPRING
</p>

<p>
<i>Oct 25.</i> She appears, and we are once more children;
we commence again our course with the new year.
Let the maiden no more return, and men will become
poets for very grief. No sooner has winter left us
time to regret her smiles, than we yield to the advances
of poetic frenzy. "The flowers look kindly at us from
the beds with their child eyes, and in the horizon the
snow of the far mountains dissolves into light vapor."—<span class="smcap">Goethe</span>,

HOW MAN GROWS
</p>

<p>
"A noble man has not to thank a private circle for his
culture. Fatherland and world must work upon him.
Fame and infamy must he learn to endure. He will be
constrained to know himself and others. Solitude shall
no more lull him with her flattery. The foe <i>will</i> not, the
friend <i>dares</i> not, spare him. Then, striving, the youth
puts forth his strength, feels what he is, and feels himself
soon a man."

ARIOSTO
</p>

<p>
"As nature decks her inward rich breast in a green
variegated dress, so clothes he all that can make men
honorable in the blooming garb of the fable.... The
well of superfluity bubbles near, and lets us see variegated
wonder-fishes. The air is filled with rare birds,
the meads and copses with strange herds, wit lurks half
concealed in the verdure, and wisdom from time to time
lets sound from a golden cloud sustained words, while
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_6" name="Page_6" href="#Page_6">6</a></span>
frenzy wildly seems to sweep the well-toned lute, yet
holds itself measured in perfect time."

THE FOG
</p>

<p>
<i>Oct. 27.</i> The prospect is limited to Nobscot and
Annursnack. The trees stand with boughs downcast like
pilgrims beaten by a storm, and the whole landscape
wears a sombre aspect.
</p>

<p>
So when thick vapors cloud the soul, it strives in
vain to escape from its humble working-day valley, and
pierce the dense fog which shuts out from view the blue
peaks in its horizon, but must be content to scan its near
and homely hills.
</p>

<p class="p2 center">
DUCKS AT GOOSE POND
</p>

<p>
<i>Oct 29.</i> Two ducks, of the summer or wood species,
which were merrily dabbling in their favorite basin,
struck up a retreat on my approach, and seemed disposed
to take French leave, paddling off with swan-like
majesty. They are first-rate swimmers, beating me at
a round pace, and—what was to me a new trait in the
duck character—dove every minute or two and swam
several feet under water, in order to escape our attention.
Just before immersion they seemed to give each other
a significant nod, and then, as if by a common understanding,
'twas heels up and head down in the shaking
of a duck's wing. When they reappeared, it was amusing
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_7" name="Page_7" href="#Page_7">7</a></span>
to observe with what a self-satisfied, darn-it-how-he-nicks-'em
air they paddled off to repeat the experiment.
</p>

<p class="p2 center">
THE ARROWHEAD
</p>

<p>
A curious incident happened some four or six weeks
ago which I think it worth the while to record. John
and I had been searching for Indian relics, and been
successful enough to find two arrowheads and a pestle,
when, of a Sunday evening, with our heads full of the
past and its remains, we strolled to the mouth of Swamp
Bridge Brook. As we neared the brow of the hill forming
the bank of the river, inspired by my theme, I
broke forth into an extravagant eulogy on those savage
times, using most violent gesticulations by way of illustration.
"There on Nawshawtuct," said I, "was their
lodge, the rendezvous of the tribe, and yonder, on Clamshell
Hill, their feasting ground. This was, no doubt, a
favorite haunt; here on this brow was an eligible lookout
post. How often have they stood on this very spot,
at this very hour, when the sun was sinking behind
yonder woods and gilding with his last rays the waters
of the Musketaquid, and pondered the day's success
and the morrow's prospects, or communed with the
spirit of their fathers gone before them to the land
of shades!
</p>

<p>
"Here," I exclaimed, "stood Tahatawan; and there"
(to complete the period) "is Tahatawan's arrowhead."
</p>

<p>
We instantly proceeded to sit down on the spot I had
pointed to, and I, to carry out the joke, to lay bare an
ordinary stone which my whim had selected, when lo!
the first I laid hands on, the grubbing stone that was to
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_8" name="Page_8" href="#Page_8">8</a></span>
be, proved a most perfect arrowhead, as sharp as if just
from the hands of the Indian fabricator!!!
</p>

<p class="p2 center">
SUNRISE
</p>

<p>
<i>Oct. 30.</i> First we have the gray twilight of the poets,
with dark and barry clouds diverging to the zenith.
Then glows the intruding cloud in the east, as if it bore
a precious jewel in its bosom; a deep round gulf of
golden gray indenting its upper edge, while slender
rules of fleecy vapor, radiating from the common centre,
like light-armed troops, fall regularly into their places.
</p>

<p class="p2 center">
SAILING WITH AND AGAINST THE STREAM
</p>

<p>
<i>Nov. 3.</i> If one would reflect, let him embark on some
placid stream, and float with the current. He cannot resist
the Muse. As we ascend the stream, plying the paddle
with might and main, snatched and impetuous thoughts
course through the brain. We dream of conflict, power,
and grandeur. But turn the prow down stream, and rock,
tree, kine, knoll, assuming new and varying positions, as
wind and water shift the scene, favor the liquid lapse of
thought, far-reaching and sublime, but ever calm and
gently undulating.
</p>

<p class="p2 center">
TRUTH
</p>

<p>
<i>Nov. 5.</i> Truth strikes us from behind, and in the
dark, as well as from before and in broad daylight.
</p>

<p class="p2 center">
STILL STREAMS RUN DEEPEST
</p>

<p>
<i>Nov. 9.</i> It is the rill whose "silver sands and pebbles
sing eternal ditties with the spring." The early
frosts bridge its narrow channel, and its querulous note
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_9" name="Page_9" href="#Page_9">9</a></span>
is hushed. Only the flickering sunlight on its sandy
bottom attracts the beholder. But there are souls whose
depths are never fathomed,—on whose bottom the sun
never shines. We get a distant view from the precipitous
banks, but never a draught from their mid-channels.
Only a sunken rock or fallen oak can provoke a murmur,
and their surface is a stranger to the icy fetters
which bind fast a thousand contributory rills.<a name='FA_5' id='FA_5' href='#FN_5' class='fnanchor'>[5]</a>

<p class="p2 center">
DISCIPLINE
</p>

<p>
<i>Nov. 12.</i> I yet lack discernment to distinguish the
whole lesson of to-day; but it is not lost,—it will come
to me at last. My desire is to know <i>what</i> I have lived,
that I may know <i>how</i> to live henceforth.

SIN DESTROYS THE PERCEPTION OF THE BEAUTIFUL

pacing the heavens in queen-like majesty, with the accustomed

GOETHE
</p>

<p>
<i>Nov. 15.</i> "And now that it is evening, a few clouds
in the mild atmosphere rest upon the mountains, more
stand still than move in the heavens, and immediately
after sunset the chirping of crickets begins to increase;
then feels one once more at home in the world, and not
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_10" name="Page_10" href="#Page_10">10</a></span>
as an alien,—an exile. I am contented as though I had
been born and brought up here, and now returned from
a Greenland or whaling voyage. Even the dust of my
Fatherland, as it is whirled about the wagon, which
for so long a time I had not seen, is welcome. The
clock-and-bell jingling of the crickets is very agreeable,
penetrating, and not without a meaning. Pleasant is it
when roguish boys whistle in emulation of a field of such
songstresses. One imagines that they really enhance
each other. The evening is perfectly mild as the day.
Should an inhabitant of the south, coming from the
south, hear of my rapture, he would deem me very
childish. Alas! what I here express have I long felt
under an unpropitious heaven. And now this joy is to
me an exception, which I am henceforth to enjoy,—a
necessity of my nature."—<i>Italiänische Reise.</i><a name='FA_6' id='FA_6' href='#FN_6' class='fnanchor'>[6]</a>

error wandering," the jugular vein of Musketaquid.
Who knows how much of the proverbial moderation of
the inhabitants was caught from its dull circulation?
</p>

<p>
The snow gives the landscape a washing-day appearance,—here
a streak of white, there a streak of dark;
it is spread like a napkin over the hills and meadows.
This must be a rare drying day, to judge from the
vapor that floats over the vast clothes-yard.

<p>
A hundred guns are firing and a flag flying in the
village in celebration of the whig victory. Now a short
dull report,—the mere disk of a sound, shorn of its

HARMONY
</p>

<p>
Nature makes no noise. The howling storm, the
rustling leaf, the pattering rain are no disturbance, there
is an essential and unexplored harmony in them. Why
is it that thought flows with so deep and sparkling a
current when the sound of distant music strikes the ear?
When I would muse I complain not of a rattling tune
on the piano—a Battle of Prague even—if it be harmony,
but an irregular, discordant drumming is intolerable.

When a shadow flits across the landscape of the soul,

<i>Nov. 20.</i> I would read Virgil, if only that I might

I take satisfaction in "<span lang="la">jam laeto turgent in palmite

NAWSHAWTUCT

a world he inhabits. In the midst of this Indian summer
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_13" name="Page_13" href="#Page_13">13</a></span>
I am perched on the topmost rock of Nawshawtuct,
a velvet wind blowing from the southwest. I seem to
feel the atoms as they strike my cheek. Hills, mountains,
steeples stand out in bold relief in the horizon,
while I am resting on the rounded boss of an enormous
shield, the river like a vein of silver encircling its edge,
and thence the shield gradually rises to its rim, the
horizon. Not a cloud is to be seen, but villages, villas,
forests, mountains, one above another, till they are swallowed
up in the heavens.<a name='FA_11' id='FA_11' href='#FN_11' class='fnanchor'>[11]</a> The atmosphere is such that,
as I look abroad upon the length and breadth of the
land, it recedes from my eye, and I seem to be looking
for the threads of the velvet.
</p>

<p>
Thus I admire the grandeur of my emerald carriage,
with its border of blue, in which I am rolling through
space.
</p>

<p class="p2 center">
THOUGHTS
</p>

<p>
<i>Nov. 26.</i> I look around for thoughts when I am overflowing
myself. While I live on, thought is still in embryo,—it
stirs not within me. Anon it begins to assume
shape and comeliness, and I deliver it, and clothe it in
its garment of language. But alas! how often when
thoughts choke me do I resort to a spat on the back, or
swallow a crust, or do anything but expectorate them!
</p>

<p class="p2 center">
HOAR FROST AND GREEN RIVER
</p>

<p>
<i>Nov. 28.</i> Every tree, fence, and spire of grass that
could raise its head above the snow was this morning
covered with a dense hoar frost. The trees looked like
airy creatures of darkness caught napping. On this side
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_14" name="Page_14" href="#Page_14">14</a></span>
they were huddled together, their gray hairs streaming,
in a secluded valley which the sun had not yet penetrated,
and on that they went hurrying off in Indian file
by hedgerows and watercourses, while the shrubs and
grasses, like elves and fairies of the night, sought to hide
their diminished heads in the snow.
</p>

<p>
The branches and taller grasses were covered with a
wonderful ice-foliage, answering leaf for leaf to their
summer dress. The centre, diverging, and even more
minute fibres were perfectly distinct and the edges regularly
indented.
</p>

<p>
These leaves were on the side of the twig or stubble
opposite to the sun (when it was not bent toward the
east), meeting it for the most part at right angles, and
there were others standing out at all possible angles
upon these, and upon one another.
</p>

<p>
It struck me that these ghost leaves and the green
ones whose forms they assume were the creatures of the
same law. It could not be in obedience to two several
laws that the vegetable juices swelled gradually into the

ICE-HARP
</p>

<p>
<i>Dec. 5.</i> My friend tells me he has discovered a new
note in nature, which he calls the Ice-Harp. Chancing
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_15" name="Page_15" href="#Page_15">15</a></span>
to throw a handful of pebbles upon the pond where there
was an air chamber under the ice, it discoursed a
pleasant music to him.
</p>

<p>
Herein resides a tenth muse, and as he was the man to
discover it probably the extra melody is in him.
</p>

<p class="p2 center">
GOETHE
</p>

<p>
<i>Dec. 8.</i> He is generally satisfied with giving an exact
description of objects as they appear to him, and his
genius is exhibited in the points he seizes upon and
illustrates. His description of Venice and her environs
as seen from the Marcusthurm is that of an unconcerned
spectator, whose object is faithfully to describe what
he sees, and that, too, for the most part, in the order in
which he saw it. It is this trait which is chiefly to be
prized in the book; even the reflections of the author do
not interfere with his descriptions.

invaluable books.<a name='FA_13' id='FA_13' href='#FN_13' class='fnanchor'>[13]</a>

MEASURE
</p>

<p>
<i>Dec. 10.</i> Not the carpenter alone carries his rule in
his pocket. Space is quite subdued to us. The meanest
peasant finds in a hair of his head, or the white crescent
upon his nail, the unit of measure for the distance of
the fixed stars. His middle finger measures how many
<i>digits</i> into space; he extends a few times his thumb and
finger, and the continent is <i>spanned</i>; he stretches out
his arms, and the sea is <i>fathomed</i>.

THOUGHT

way through the underwood of words to the clear blue
beyond;
</p>

PECULIARITY
</p>

<p>
When we speak of a peculiarity in a man or a nation,
we think to describe only one part, a mere mathematical
point; but it is not so. It pervades all. Some parts may
be further removed than others from this centre, but
not a particle so remote as not to be either shined on or
shaded by it.
</p>

<p class="p2 center">
THORNS
</p>

<p>
No faculty in man was created with a useless or
sinister intent; in no respect can he be wholly bad, but
the worst passions have their root in the best,—as
anger, for instance, may be only a perverted sense of
wrong which yet retains some traces of its origin.<a name='FA_14' id='FA_14' href='#FN_14' class='fnanchor'>[14]</a> So a
spine is proved to be only an abortive branch, "which,
notwithstanding, even as a spine, bears leaves, and, in
<i>Euphorbia heptagona</i>, sometimes flowers and fruit."

JACK FROST
</p>

<p>
<i>Dec. 15.</i> As further confirmation of the fact that vegetation
is a kind of crystallization, I observe that upon
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_17" name="Page_17" href="#Page_17">17</a></span>
the edge of the melting frost on the windows, Jack is
playing singular freaks,—now bundling together his
needle-shaped leaves so as to resemble fields waving
with grain, or shocks of wheat rising here and there from
the stubble. On one side the vegetation of the torrid
zone is presented you,—high-towering palms, and widespread
banyans, such as we see in pictures of Oriental
scenery; on the other are arctic pines, stiff-frozen, with
branches downcast, like the arms of tender men in frosty
weather.<a name='FA_15' id='FA_15' href='#FN_15' class='fnanchor'>[15]</a> In some instances the panes are covered
with little feathery flocks, where the particles radiate
from a common centre, the number of radii varying
from three to seven or eight. The crystalline particles
are partial to the creases and flaws in the glass, and,
when these extend from sash to sash, form complete
hedgerows, or miniature watercourses, where dense
masses of crystal foliage "high over-arched imbower."

<p class="p2 center">
FROZEN MIST
</p>

<p>
<i>Dec. 16.</i> The woods were this morning covered with
thin bars of vapor,—the evaporation of the leaves
according to Sprengel,—which seemed to have been
suddenly stiffened by the cold. In some places it was
spread out like gauze over the tops of the trees, forming
extended lawns, where elves and fairies held high
tournament;

The east was glowing with a narrow but ill-defined
crescent of light, the blue of the zenith mingling in all

And now the neighboring hilltops telegraph to us

in the east, and anon his "long levelled rules" fall sector-wise,
and humblest cottage windows greet their lord.

FACTS
</p>

<p>
How indispensable to a correct study of Nature is a
perception of her true meaning. The fact will one day
flower out into a truth. The season will mature and
fructify what the understanding had cultivated. Mere
accumulators of facts—collectors of materials for the
master-workmen—are like those plants growing in dark
forests, which "put forth only leaves instead of blossoms."
</p>

<p class="p2 center">
DRUIDS
</p>

<p>
<i>Dec. 17.</i> In all ages and nations we observe a leaning
towards a right state of things. This may especially be
seen in the history of the priest, whose life approaches
most nearly to that of the ideal man. The Druids paid
no taxes, and "were allowed exemption from warfare
and all other things." The clergy are even now a privileged
class.
</p>

<p>
In the last stage of civilization Poetry, Religion, and
Philosophy will be one; and this truth is glimpsed in
the first. The druidical order was divided into Druids,
Bards, and Ouates. "The Bards were the poets and
musicians, of whom some were satirists, and some encomiasts.
The Ouates sacrificed, divined, and contemplated
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_19" name="Page_19" href="#Page_19">19</a></span>
the nature of things. The Druids cultivated
physiology and moral philosophy; or, as Diodorus says,
were their philosophers and theologians."

<p class="p2 center">
GOETHE

IMMORTALITY POST
</p>

<p>
The nations assert an immortality <i>post</i> as well as

an emblem that they sprang from the earth, and the
Arcadians pretended that they were <span lang="gr_GR">προσέληνοι</span>, or before

SAXONS

<p>
The fact seems at first an anomalous one that the less

are of their rights. The Saxons of Ditmarsia contended
for a principle, not for their sterile sands and uncultivated
marshes.
</p>

<p>
We are on the whole the same Saxons that our fathers
were, when it was said of them, "They are emulous
in hospitality, because to plunder and to lavish is
the glory of an Holsatian; not to be versed in the
science of depredation is, in his opinion, to be stupid
and base."

CRYSTALS
</p>

<p>
I observed this morning that the ice at Swamp Bridge
was checkered with a kind of mosaic-work of white
creases or channels; and when I examined the under
side, I found it to be covered with a mass of crystallizations
from three to five inches deep, standing, or rather
depending, at right angles to the true ice, which was
about an eighth of an inch thick. There was a yet older
ice six or eight inches below this. The crystals were for
the most part triangular prisms with the lower end
open, though, in some cases, they had run into each
other so as to form four or five sided prisms. When the
ice was laid upon its smooth side, they resembled the
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_21" name="Page_21" href="#Page_21">21</a></span>
roofs and steeples of a Gothic city, or the vessels of a
crowded haven under a press of canvas.
</p>

<p>
I noticed also that where the ice in the road had
melted and left the mud bare, the latter, as if crystallized,
discovered countless rectilinear fissures, an inch
or more in length—a continuation, as it were, of the
checkered ice.<a name='FA_18' id='FA_18' href='#FN_18' class='fnanchor'>[18]</a>
</p>

<p class="p2">
<i>Dec. 22.</i> About a year ago, having set aside a bowl
which had contained some rhubarb grated in water,
without wiping it, I was astonished to find, a few days
afterward, that the rhubarb had crystallized, covering the
bottom of the bowl with perfect cubes, of the color and
consistency of glue, and a tenth of an inch in diameter.
</p>

<p class="p2 center">
CRYSTALS
</p>

<p>
<i>Dec. 23.</i> Crossed the river to-day on the ice. Though
the weather is raw and wintry and the ground covered
with snow, I noticed a solitary robin, who looked as if he
needed to have his services to the Babes in the Woods
speedily requited.
</p>

<p>
In the side of the high bank by the Leaning Hemlocks,
there were some curious crystallizations. Wherever
the water, or other causes, had formed a hole in the
bank, its throat and outer edge, like the entrance to a
citadel of the olden time, bristled with a glistening ice
armor. In one place you might see minute ostrich
feathers, which seemed the waving plumes of the warriors
filing into the fortress, in another the glancing
fan-shaped banners of the Lilliputian host, and in another
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_22" name="Page_22" href="#Page_22">22</a></span>
the needle-shaped particles, collected into bundles
resembling the plumes of the pine, might pass for a
phalanx of spears.<a name='FA_19' id='FA_19' href='#FN_19' class='fnanchor'>[19]</a> The whole hill was like an immense
quartz rock, with minute crystals sparkling from innumerable
crannies. I tried to fancy that there was a
disposition in these crystallizations to take the forms of
the contiguous foliage.

<p class="p2 center">
REVOLUTIONS
</p>

<p>
<i>Dec. 27.</i> Revolutions are never sudden. Not one man,
nor many men, in a few years or generations, suffice to
regulate events and dispose mankind for the revolutionary
movement. The hero is but the crowning stone
of the pyramid,—the keystone of the arch. Who was
Romulus or Remus, Hengist or Horsa, that we should
attribute to them Rome or England? They are famous
or infamous because the progress of events has chosen
to make them its stepping-stones. But we would know
where the avalanche commenced, or the hollow in the
rock whence springs the Amazon. The most important
is apt to be some silent and unobtrusive fact in history.
In 449 three Saxon cyules arrived on the British coast,—"Three
scipen gode comen mid than flode, three hundred
cnihten."<a name='FA_20' id='FA_20' href='#FN_20' class='fnanchor'>[20]</a> The pirate of the British coast was no
more the founder of a state than the scourge of the
German shore.

<p class="p2 center">
HEROES
</p>

<p>
The real heroes of minstrelsy have been ideal, even
when the names of actual heroes have been perpetuated.
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_23" name="Page_23" href="#Page_23">23</a></span>
The real Arthur, who "not only excelled the experienced
past, but also the possible future," of whom it
was affirmed for many centuries that he was not dead,
but "had withdrawn from the world into some magical
region; from which at a future crisis he was to reappear,
and lead the Cymri in triumph through the
island," whose character and actions were the theme
of the bards of Bretagne and the foundation of their
interminable romances, was only an ideal impersonation.
</p>

<p class="caption"><i>Frost Crystals</i></p>
</div>

<p>
Men claim for the ideal an actual existence also, but
do not often expand the actual into the ideal. "If you
do not believe me, go into Bretagne, and mention in the
streets or villages, that Arthur is really dead like other
men; you will not escape with impunity; you will be
either hooted with the curses of your hearers, or stoned
to death."
</p>

<p class="p2 center">
HOMESICKNESS
</p>

<p>
The most remarkable instance of homesickness is
that of the colony of Franks transplanted by the Romans
from the German Ocean to the Euxine, who at
length resolving to a man to abandon the country,
seized the vessels which carried them out, and reached
at last their native shores, after innumerable difficulties
and dangers upon the Mediterranean and Atlantic.

THE INTERESTING FACTS IN HISTORY
</p>

<p>
How cheering is it, after toiling through the darker
pages of history,—the heartless and fluctuating crust
of human rest and unrest,—to alight on the solid
earth where the sun shines, or rest in the checkered
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_24" name="Page_24" href="#Page_24">24</a></span>
shade. The fact that Edwin of Northumbria "caused
stakes to be fixed in the highways where he had seen a
clear spring," and that "brazen dishes were chained to
them, to refresh the weary sojourner, whose fatigues
Edwin had himself experienced," is worth all Arthur's
twelve battles.<a name='FA_21' id='FA_21' href='#FN_21' class='fnanchor'>[21]</a> The sun again shines along the highway,
the landscape presents us sunny glades and occasional
cultivated patches as well as dark primeval
forests, and it is merry England after all.

HOAR FROST

Every leaf and twig was this morning covered with
a sparkling ice armor; even the grasses in exposed
fields were hung with innumerable diamond pendants,
which jingled merrily when brushed by the foot of the
traveller. It was literally the wreck of jewels and the
crash of gems. It was as though some superincumbent
stratum of the earth had been removed in the night,
exposing to light a bed of untarnished crystals. The
scene changed at every step, or as the head was inclined

ZENO
</p>

<p>
<i>Feb. 7.</i> Zeno, the Stoic, stood in precisely the same
relation to the world that I do now. He is, forsooth,
bred a merchant—as how many still!—and can trade
and barter, and perchance higgle, and moreover he can
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_27" name="Page_27" href="#Page_27">27</a></span>
be shipwrecked and cast ashore at the Piræus, like one
of your Johns or Thomases.
</p>

<p>
He strolls into a shop and is charmed by a book by
Xenophon—and straightway he becomes a philosopher.
The sun of a new life's day rises to him,—serene
and unclouded,—which looks over <span lang="gr_GR">στοά</span>. And still the
fleshly Zeno sails on, shipwrecked, buffeted, tempest-tossed;
but the true Zeno sails ever a placid sea. Play
high, play low,—rain, sleet, or snow,—it's all the
same with the Stoic. "Propriety and decorum" were
his Palinurus,—not the base progeny of fashion, but
the suggestions of an experienced taste.
</p>

<p>
When evening comes he sits down unwearied to the
review of his day,—what's done that's to be undone,—what
not done at all still to be done. Himself Truth's
unconcerned helpmate. Another system of book-keeping
this than that the Cyprian trader to Phœnicia practiced!
</p>

<p>
This was he who said to a certain garrulous young
man, "On this account have we two ears and but one
mouth, that we may hear more, and speak less."
</p>

<p>
That he had talked concerned not our philosopher,
but his audience; and herein we may see how it is more
noble to hear than to speak. The wisest may apologize
that he only said so to hear himself talk, for if he <i>heard</i>
not, as well for him had he never spoken. What is all

If you mistake these Messieurs and Mesdames for so

the peaceful Tempe or ruffle the bosom of the placid
Ægean; but always the beams of the summer's sun
gleam along the entablature of the Acropolis, or are
reflected through the mellow atmosphere from a thousand
consecrated groves and fountains; always her sea-girt
isles are dallying with their zephyr guests, and the
low of kine is heard along the meads, and the landscape
sleeps—valley and hill and woodland—a dreamy sleep.
Each of her sons created a new heaven and a new earth

inches of snow, and I contrived to smuggle away a grin
of satisfaction by a smothered "Pshaw! and is that all?"

GOETHE
</p>

<p>
<i>Feb. 27.</i> He jogs along at a snail's pace, but ever
mindful that the earth is beneath and the heavens above
him. His Italy is not merely the fatherland of lazzaroni
and maccaroni but a solid turf-clad soil, daily illumined
by a genial sun and nightly gleaming in the still moonshine,—to
say nothing of the frequent showers which
are so faithfully recorded. That sail to Palermo was literally
a plowing through of the waves from Naples to
Trinacria,—the sky overhead, and the sea with its isles
on either hand.
</p>

<p>
His hearty good-will to all men is most amiable; not
one cross word has he spoken, but on one occasion, the
post boy snivelling, "<span lang="it_IT">Signore, perdonate! quésta è la
mia patria</span>," he confesses, "to me poor northerner came
something tear-like into the eyes."<a name='FA_25' id='FA_25' href='#FN_25' class='fnanchor'>[25]</a>

SPRING
</p>

<p>
<i>March 1.</i> March fans it, April christens it, and May
puts on its jacket and trousers. It never grows up, but
Alexandrian-like "drags its slow length along," ever
springing, bud following close upon leaf, and when
winter comes it is not annihilated, but creeps on mole-like
under the snow, showing its face nevertheless occasionally
by fuming springs and watercourses.
</p>

<p>
So let it be with man,—let his manhood be a more
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_31" name="Page_31" href="#Page_31">31</a></span>
advanced and still advancing youth, bud following hard
upon leaf. By the side of the ripening corn let's have a
second or third crop of peas and turnips, decking the
fields in a new green. So amid clumps of sere herd's-grass
sometimes flower the violet and buttercup
spring-born.
</p>

<p class="p2 center">
HOMER
</p>

<p>
<i>March 3.</i> Three thousand years and the world so
little changed! The Iliad seems like a natural sound
which has reverberated to our days. Whatever in it is
still freshest in the memories of men was most childlike
in the poet. It is the problem of old age,—a second
childhood exhibited in the life of the world. Phœbus
Apollo went like night,—<span lang="gr_GR">ὁ δ' ἤιε νυκτὶ ἐοικώς</span>. This either
refers to the gross atmosphere of the plague darkening
the sun, or to the crescent of night rising solemn
and stately in the east while the sun is setting in the west.
</p>

<p>
Then Agamemnon darkly lowers on Calchas, prophet
of evil,—<span lang="gr_GR">ὄσσε δέ οἱ πυρὶ λαμπετόωντε ἐΐκτην</span>,—such a fire-eyed
Agamemnon as you may see at town meetings
and elections, as well here as in Troy neighborhood.
</p>

<p class="p2 center">
A SUNDAY SCENE
</p>

<p>
<i>March 4.</i> Here at my elbow sit five notable, or at least
noteworthy, representatives of this nineteenth century,—of
the gender feminine. One a sedate, indefatigable
knitter, not spinster, of the old school, who had the
supreme felicity to be born in days that tried men's
souls, who can, and not unfrequently does, say with
Nestor, another of the old school: "But you are younger
than I. For time was when I conversed with greater
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_32" name="Page_32" href="#Page_32">32</a></span>
men than you. For not at any time have I seen such
men, nor shall see them, as Perithous, and Dryas, and
<span lang="gr_GR">ποιμένα λαῶν</span>," or, in one word, sole "shepherd of the
people," Washington.
</p>

<p>
And when Apollo has now six times rolled westward,
or seemed to roll, and now for the seventh time shows
his face in the east, eyes well-nigh glazed, long glassed,
which have fluctuated only between lamb's wool and
worsted, explore ceaseless some good sermon book. For
six days shalt thou labor and do all thy knitting, but on
the seventh, forsooth, thy reading.<a name='FA_26' id='FA_26' href='#FN_26' class='fnanchor'>[26]</a>
</p>

<p>
Opposite, across this stone hearth, sits one of no
school, but rather one who schools, a spinster who spins
not, with elbow resting on the book of books, but with
eyes turned towards the vain trumpery of that shelf,—trumpery
of sere leaves, blossoms, and waxwork, built
on sand, that presumes to look quite as gay, smell quite
as earthy, as though this were not by good rights the
sun's day. I marked how she spurned that innocent
every-day book, "Germany by De Staël," as though a
viper had stung her;—better to rest the elbow on The
Book than the eye on such a page. Poor book! this is
thy last chance.
</p>

<p>
Happy I who can bask in this warm spring sun which
illumines all creatures, as well when they rest as when
they toil, not without a feeling of gratitude! whose life
is as blameless—how blameworthy soever it be—on
the Lord's Mona-day as on his Suna-day!<a name='FA_27' id='FA_27' href='#FN_27' class='fnanchor'>[27]</a>
</p>

<p>
Thus much at least a man may do: he may not impose
on his fellows,—perhaps not on himself. Thus
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_33" name="Page_33" href="#Page_33">33</a></span>
much <i>let</i> a man do: confidently and heartily live up to
his thought; for its error, if there be any, will soonest
appear in practice, and if there be none, so much he may
reckon as actual progress in the way of living.

with fresher sweet; then, as now, whene'er from

WHAT TO DO
</p>

<p>
But what does all this scribbling amount to? What
is now scribbled in the heat of the moment one can
contemplate with somewhat of satisfaction, but alas!
to-morrow—aye, to-night—it is stale, flat, and unprofitable,—in
fine, is not, only its shell remains, like
some red parboiled lobster-shell which, kicked aside
never so often, still stares at you in the path.
</p>

<p>
What may a man do and not be ashamed of it? He
may not do nothing surely, for straightway he is dubbed
Dolittle—aye! christens himself first—and reasonably,
for he was first to duck. But let him do something,
is he the less a Dolittle? Is it actually something done,
or not rather something undone; or, if done, is it not
badly done, or at most well done comparatively?
</p>

<p>
Such is man,—toiling, heaving, struggling ant-like
to shoulder some stray unappropriated crumb and
deposit it in his granary; then runs out, complacent,
gazes heavenward, earthward (for even pismires can
look down), heaven and earth meanwhile looking downward,
upward; there seen of men, world-seen, deed-delivered,
vanishes into all-grasping night. And is he
doomed ever to run the same course? Can he not,
wriggling, screwing, self-exhorting, self-constraining,
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_35" name="Page_35" href="#Page_35">35</a></span>
wriggle or screw out something that shall live,—respected,

his nails, while the earth goes gyrating ahead amid such
a din of sphere music, whirling him along about her axis
some twenty-four thousand miles between sun and sun,
but mainly in a circle some two millions of miles actual
progress? And then such a hurly-burly on the surface—wind
always blowing—now a zephyr, now a hurricane—tides
never idle, ever fluctuating—no rest for
Niagara, but perpetual ran-tan on those limestone rocks—and
then that summer simmering which our ears are
used to, which would otherwise be christened confusion
worse confounded, but is now ironically called "silence
audible," and above all the incessant tinkering named
"hum of industry," the hurrying to and fro and confused
jabbering of men. Can man do less than get up
and shake himself?

COMPOSITION
</p>

<p>
<i>March 7.</i> We should not endeavor coolly to analyze
our thoughts, but, keeping the pen even and parallel
with the current, make an accurate transcript of them.
Impulse is, after all, the best linguist, and for his logic,
if not conformable to Aristotle, it cannot fail to be most
convincing. The nearer we approach to a complete but
simple transcript of our thought the more tolerable will
be the piece, for we can endure to consider ourselves
in a state of passivity or in involuntary action, but rarely
our efforts, and least of all our rare efforts.

SCRAPS FROM A LECTURE ON "SOCIETY" WRITTEN MARCH
14TH, 1838, DELIVERED BEFORE OUR LYCEUM, APRIL
11TH
</p>

<p>
Every proverb in the newspapers originally stood
for a truth. Thus the proverb that man was made for
society, so long as it was not allowed to conflict with
another important truth, deceived no one; but, now that
the same words have come to stand for another thing,
it may be for a lie, we are obliged, in order to preserve
its significance, to write it anew, so that properly it will
read, Society was made for man.
</p>

<p class="p2">
Man is not at once born into society,—hardly into
the world. The world that he is hides for a time the
world that he inhabits.
</p>

<p class="p2">
That which properly constitutes the life of every man is
a profound secret. Yet this is what every one would give
most to know, but is himself most backward to impart.
</p>

<p class="p2">
Hardly a rood of land but can show its fresh wound
or indelible scar, in proof that earlier or later man has
been there.
</p>

<p class="p2">
The mass never comes up to the standard of its best
member, but on the contrary degrades itself to a level
with the lowest. As the reformers say, it is a levelling
down, not up. Hence the mass is only another name
for the mob. The inhabitants of the earth assembled
in one place would constitute the greatest mob. The
mob is spoken of as an insane and blinded animal;
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_37" name="Page_37" href="#Page_37">37</a></span>
magistrates say it must be humored; they apprehend
it may incline this way or that, as villagers dread an
inundation, not knowing whose land may be flooded,
nor how many bridges carried away.
</p>

<p class="p2">
One goes to a cattle-show expecting to find many men
and women assembled, and beholds only working oxen
and neat cattle. He goes to a commencement thinking
that there at least he may find the men of the country;
but such, if there were any, are completely merged in
the day, and have become so many walking commencements,
so that he is fain to take himself out of sight
and hearing of the orator, lest he lose his own identity
in the nonentities around him.
</p>

<p class="p2">
But you are getting all the while further and further
from true society. Your silence was an approach to it,
but your conversation is only a refuge from the encounter
of men; as though men were to be satisfied with
a meeting of heels, and not heads.
</p>

<p>
Nor is it better with private assemblies, or meetings
together, with a sociable design, of acquaintances so
called,—that is to say of men and women who are
familiar with the lineaments of each other's countenances,
who eat, drink, sleep, and transact the business
of living within the circuit of a mile.
</p>

<p>
With a beating heart he fares him forth, by the light
of the stars, to this meeting of gods. But the illusion
speedily vanishes; what at first seemed to him nectar
and ambrosia, is discovered to be plain bohea and short
gingerbread.
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_38" name="Page_38" href="#Page_38">38</a></span>
</p>

<p>
Then with what speed does he throw off his strait-jacket
of a godship, and play the one-eared, two-mouthed
mortal, thus proving his title to the epithet
applied to him of old by Homer of <span lang="gr_GR">μέροψ ἄνθρωπος</span>,
or that possesses an articulating voice. But unfortunately
we have as yet invented no rule by which the
stranger may know when he has culminated. We read
that among the Finlanders when one "has succeeded
in rendering himself agreeable, it is a custom at an
assemblage for all the women present to give him on the
back a sudden slap, when it is least expected; and the
compliment is in proportion to the weight of the blow."
</p>

<p class="p2">
It is provoking, when one sits waiting the assembling
together of his neighbors around his hearth, to behold
merely their clay houses, for the most part newly
shingled and clapboarded, and not unfrequently with a
fresh coat of paint, trundled to his door. He has but to
knock slightly at the outer gate of one of these shingle
palaces, to be assured that the master or mistress is not
at home.
</p>

<p>
After all, the field of battle possesses many advantages
over the drawing-room. There at least is no room
for pretension or excessive ceremony, no shaking of
hands or rubbing of noses, which make one doubt your
sincerity, but hearty as well as hard hand-play. It at
least exhibits one of the faces of humanity, the former
only a mask.
</p>

<p class="p2">
The utmost nearness to which men approach each
other amounts barely to a mechanical contact. As
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_39" name="Page_39" href="#Page_39">39</a></span>
when you rub two stones together, though they emit
an audible sound, yet do they not actually touch each
other.
</p>

<p class="p2">
In obedience to an instinct of their nature men have
pitched their cabins and planted corn and potatoes
within speaking distance of one another, and so formed
towns and villages, but they have not associated, they
have only assembled, and society has signified only a
<i>convention</i> of men.
</p>

<p class="p2">
When I think of a playhouse, it is as if we had not
time to appreciate the follies of the day in detail as
they occur, and so devoted an hour of our evening to
laughing or crying at them in the lump. Despairing of
a more perfect intercourse, or perhaps never dreaming
that such is desirable, or at least possible, we are contented
to act our part in what deserves to be called the
great farce, not drama, of life, like pitiful and mercenary
stock actors whose business it is to keep up the semblance
of a stage.
</p>

<p class="p2">
Our least deed, like the young of the land crab, wends
its way to the sea of cause and effect as soon as born,
and makes a drop there to eternity.
</p>

<p class="p2">
Let ours be like the meeting of two planets, not
hastening to confound their jarring spheres, but drawn
together by the influence of a subtile attraction, soon to
roll diverse in their respective orbits, from this their
perigee, or point of nearest approach.
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_40" name="Page_40" href="#Page_40">40</a></span>
</p>
<p class="p2">
If thy neighbor hail thee to inquire how goes the
world, feel thyself put to thy trumps to return a true
and explicit answer. Plant the feet firmly, and, will he
nill he, dole out to him with strict and conscientious
impartiality his modicum of a response.
</p>

<p class="p2">
Let not society be the element in which you swim, or
are tossed about at the mercy of the waves, but be rather
a strip of firm land running out into the sea, whose base
is daily washed by the tide, but whose summit only the
spring tide can reach.
</p>

<p class="p2">
But after all, such a morsel of society as this will not
satisfy a man. But like those women of Malamocco and
Pelestrina, who when their husbands are fishing at sea,
repair to the shore and sing their shrill songs at evening,
till they hear the voices of their husbands in reply borne
to them over the water, so go we about indefatigably,
chanting our stanza of the lay, and awaiting the response
of a kindred soul out of the distance.

tops come so close together that shepherds on the
tops of several hills may audibly talk together, yet will
it be a day's journey for their bodies to meet, so vast
is the hollowness of the valleys betwixt them." As
much may be said in a moral sense of our intercourse
in the plains, for, though we may audibly converse
together, yet is there so vast a gulf of hollowness between
that we are actually many days' journey from a
veritable communication.

JOURNEY TO MAINE
</p>

<p>
<i>May 3-4.</i> Boston to Portland.
</p>

<p>
What, indeed, is this earth to us of New England
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_47" name="Page_47" href="#Page_47">47</a></span>
but a field for Yankee speculation? The Nantucket
whaler goes a-fishing round it, and so knows it,—what
it is, how long, how broad, and that no tortoise sustains
it. He who has visited the confines of his real estate,
looking out on all sides into space, will feel a new inducement
to <i>be</i> the lord of creation.
</p>

<p>
We must all pay a small tribute to Neptune; the chief
engineer must once have been seasick.
</p>

<p>
Midnight—head over the boat's side—between
sleeping and waking—with glimpses of one or more
lights in the vicinity of Cape Ann. Bright moonlight—the
effect heightened by seasickness. Beyond that light
yonder have my lines hitherto been cast, but now I know
that there lies not the whole world, for I can say it is
there and not here.
</p>

<p>
<i>May 4.</i> Portland. There is a proper and only right
way to enter a city, as well as to make advances to a
strange person; neither will allow of the least forwardness
nor bustle. A sensitive person can hardly elbow
his way boldly, laughing and talking, into a strange
town, without experiencing some twinges of conscience,
as when he has treated a stranger with too much familiarity.
</p>

<p>
<i>May 5.</i> Portland to Bath <i>via</i> Brunswick; Bath to
Brunswick.
</p>

<p>
Each one's world is but a clearing in the forest, so
much open and inclosed ground. When the mail coach
rumbles into one of these, the villagers gaze after you
with a compassionate look, as much as to say: "Where
have you been all this time, that you make your début
in the world at this late hour? Nevertheless, here we
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_48" name="Page_48" href="#Page_48">48</a></span>
are; come and study us, that you may learn men and
manners."
</p>

<p>
<i>May 6.</i> Brunswick to Augusta <i>via</i> Gardiner and Hallowell.
</p>

<p>
<i>May 7.</i> We occasionally meet an individual of a character
and disposition so entirely the reverse of our own
that we wonder if he can indeed be another man like
ourselves. We doubt if we ever could draw any nearer
to him, and understand him. Such was the old English
gentleman whom I met with to-day in H. Though I
peered in at his eyes I could not discern myself reflected
therein. The chief wonder was how we could
ever arrive at so fair-seeming an intercourse upon so
small ground of sympathy. He walked and fluttered
like a strange bird at my side, prying into and making
a handle of the least circumstance. The bustle and
rapidity of our communication were astonishing; we
skated in our conversation. All at once he would stop
short in the path, and, in an abstracted air, query
whether the steamboat had reached Bath or Portland,
addressing me from time to time as his familiar genius,
who could understand what was passing in his mind
without the necessity of uninterrupted oral communication.
</p>

<p>
<i>May 8.</i> Augusta to Bangor <i>via</i> China.
</p>

<p>
<i>May 10.</i> Bangor to Oldtown.
</p>

<p>
The railroad from Bangor to Oldtown is civilization
shooting off in a tangent into the forest. I had much
conversation with an old Indian at the latter place, who
sat dreaming upon a scow at the waterside and striking
his deer-skin moccasins against the planks, while his
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_49" name="Page_49" href="#Page_49">49</a></span>
arms hung listlessly by his side. He was the most communicative
man I had met. Talked of hunting and
fishing, old times and new times. Pointing up the
Penobscot, he observed, "Two or three mile up the river
one beautiful country!" and then, as if he would come
as far to meet me as I had gone to meet him, he exclaimed,
"Ugh! one very hard time!" But he had mistaken
his man.
</p>

<p>
<i>May 11.</i> Bangor to Belfast <i>via</i> Saturday Cove.
</p>

<p>
<i>May 12.</i> Belfast.
</p>

<p>
<i>May 13.</i> To Castine by sailboat "Cinderilla [<i>sic</i>]."
</p>

<p>
<i>May 14.</i> Castine to Belfast by packet, Captain Skinner.
Found the Poems of Burns and an odd volume of
the "Spectator" in the cabin.
</p>

<p>
<i>May 15.</i> Belfast to Bath <i>via</i> Thomaston.
</p>

<p>
<i>May 16.</i> To Portland.
</p>

<p>
<i>May 17.</i> To Boston and Concord.

<p>The loudest sound that burdens here the breeze</p>

HEROISM
</p>

<p>
<i>July 13.</i> What a hero one can be without moving a
finger! The world is not a field worthy of us, nor can
we be satisfied with the plains of Troy. A glorious strife
seems waging within us, yet so noiselessly that we but
just catch the sound of the clarion ringing of victory,
borne to us on the breeze. There are in each the seeds
of a heroic ardor, which need only to be stirred in with
the <i>soil where they lie</i>, by an inspired voice or pen, to
bear fruit of a divine flavor.<a name='FA_33' id='FA_33' href='#FN_33' class='fnanchor'>[33]</a>
</p>

<p class="p2 center">
SUSPICION
</p>

<p>
<i>July 15.</i> What though friends misinterpret your conduct,
if it is right in sight of God and Nature. The
wrong, if there be any, pertains only to the wrongdoer,
nor is the integrity of your relations to the universe
affected, but you may gather encouragement from their
mistrust. If the friend withhold his favor, yet does
greater float gratuitous on the zephyr.
</p>

<p class="p2 center">
TRUTH
</p>

<p>
<i>Aug. 4.</i> Whatever of past or present wisdom has
published itself to the world, is palpable falsehood till
it come and utter itself by my side.

SPHERE MUSIC
</p>

<p>
<i>Aug. 5.</i> Some sounds seem to reverberate along the
plain, and then settle to earth again like dust; such
are Noise, Discord, Jargon. But such only as spring
heavenward, and I may catch from steeples and hilltops
in their upward course, which are the more refined
parts of the former, are the true sphere music,—pure,
unmixed music,—in which no wail mingles.

DIVINE SERVICE IN THE ACADEMY HALL
</p>

<p>
In dark places and dungeons these words might
perhaps strike root and grow, but utter them in the daylight
and their dusky hues are apparent. From this
window I can compare the written with the preached
word: within is weeping, and wailing, and gnashing of
teeth; without, grain fields and grasshoppers, which
give those the lie direct.

<p class="p2 center">
THE TIME OF THE UNIVERSE
</p>

<p>
<i>Aug. 10.</i> Nor can all the vanities that so vex the world
alter one whit the measure that night has chosen, but
ever it must be short particular metre. The human soul
is a silent harp in God's quire, whose strings need only
to be swept by the divine breath to chime in with the
harmonies of creation. Every pulse-beat is in exact time
with the cricket's chant, and the tickings of the death-watch
in the wall. Alternate with these if you can.<a name='FA_34' id='FA_34' href='#FN_34' class='fnanchor'>[34]</a>

CONSCIOUSNESS
</p>

<p>
<i>Aug. 13.</i> If with closed ears and eyes I consult consciousness
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_54" name="Page_54" href="#Page_54">54</a></span>
for a moment, immediately are all walls and
barriers dissipated, earth rolls from under me, and I
float, by the impetus derived from the earth and the system,
a subjective, heavily laden thought, in the midst of
an unknown and infinite sea, or else heave and swell
like a vast ocean of thought, without rock or headland,
where are all riddles solved, all straight lines making
there their two ends to meet, eternity and space gambolling
familiarly through my depths. I am from the
beginning, knowing no end, no aim. No sun illumines
me, for I dissolve all lesser lights in my own intenser
and steadier light. I am a restful kernel in the magazine
of the universe.
</p>

<p class="p2 center">
RESOURCE
</p>

<p>
Men are constantly dinging in my ears their fair theories
and plausible solutions of the universe, but ever
there is no help, and I return again to my shoreless,
islandless ocean, and fathom unceasingly for a bottom
that will hold an anchor, that it may not drag.
</p>

<p class="p2 center">
SABBATH BELL
</p>

<p>
<i>Aug. 19.</i> The sound of the sabbath bell, whose farthest
waves are at this instant breaking on these cliffs,
does not awaken pleasing associations alone. Its muse
is wonderfully condescending and philanthropic. One
involuntarily leans on his staff to humor the unusually
meditative mood. It is as the sound of many catechisms
and religious books twanging a canting peal round the
world, and seems to issue from some Egyptian temple,
and echo along the shore of the Nile, right opposite to
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_55" name="Page_55" href="#Page_55">55</a></span>
Pharaoh's palace and Moses in the bulrushes, startling
a multitude of storks and alligators basking in the sun.
Not so these larks and pewees of Musketaquid. One
is sick at heart of this pagoda worship. It is like the
beating of gongs in a Hindoo subterranean temple.<a name='FA_35' id='FA_35' href='#FN_35' class='fnanchor'>[35]</a>

HOLY WAR
</p>

<p>
<i>Aug. 21.</i> Passion and appetite are always an unholy
land in which one may wage most holy war. Let him
steadfastly follow the banner of his faith till it is planted
on the enemy's citadel. Nor shall he lack fields to display
his valor in, nor straits worthy of him. For when
he has blown his blast, and smote those within reach,
invisible enemies will not cease to torment him, who yet
may be starved out in the garrisons where they lie.

<p class="p2 center">
SCRIPTURE
</p>

<p>
<i>Aug. 22.</i> How thrilling a noble sentiment in the oldest
books,—in Homer, the Zendavesta, or Confucius!
It is a strain of music wafted down to us on the breeze
of time, through the aisles of innumerable ages. By its
very nobleness it is made near and audible to us.
</p>

<p class="p2 center">
EVENING SOUNDS
</p>

<p>
<i>Aug. 26.</i> How strangely sounds of revelry strike the
ear from over cultivated fields by the woodside, while
the sun is declining in the west. It is a world we had not
known before. We listen and are capable of no mean
act or thought. We tread on Olympus and participate
in the councils of the gods.

HOMER

<p>
It does one's heart good if Homer but say the sun sets,—or,
"As when beautiful stars accompany the bright
moon through the serene heavens; and the woody hills
and cliffs are discerned through the mild light, and each
star is visible, and the shepherd rejoices in his heart."<a name='FA_36' id='FA_36' href='#FN_36' class='fnanchor'>[36]</a>

THE LOSS OF A TOOTH
</p>

<p>
<i>Aug. 27.</i> Verily I am the creature of circumstances.
Here I have swallowed an indispensable tooth, and so am
no whole man, but a lame and halting piece of manhood.
I am conscious of no gap in my soul, but it would seem
that, now the entrance to the oracle has been enlarged,
the more rare and commonplace the responses that issue
from it. I have felt cheap, and hardly dared hold up my
head among men, ever since this accident happened. Nothing
can I do as well and freely as before; nothing do
I undertake but I am hindered and balked by this circumstance.
What a great matter a little spark kindleth!
I believe if I were called at this moment to rush into the
thickest of the fight, I should halt for lack of so insignificant
a piece of armor as a tooth. Virtue and Truth go
undefended, and Falsehood and Affectation are thrown
in my teeth,—though I am toothless. One does not need
that the earth quake for the sake of excitement, when so
slight a crack proves such an impassable moat. But let
the lame man shake his leg, and match himself with the
fleetest in the race. So shall he do what is in him to do.
But let him who has lost a tooth open his mouth wide
and gabble, lisp, and sputter never so resolutely.

DEFORMITY
</p>

<p>
<i>Aug. 29.</i> Here at the top of Nawshawtuct, this mild
August afternoon, I can discern no deformed thing.
The prophane hay-makers in yonder meadow are yet the
hay-makers of poetry,—forsooth Faustus and Amyntas.
Yonder schoolhouse of brick, than which, near at
hand, nothing can be more mote-like to my eye, serves
even to heighten the picturesqueness of the scene. Barns
and outbuildings, which in the nearness mar by their
presence the loveliness of nature, are not only endurable,
but, observed where they lie by some waving field of
grain or patch of woodland, prove a very cynosure to
the pensive eye. Let man after infinite hammering and
din of crows uprear a deformity in the plain, yet will
Nature have her revenge on the hilltop. Retire a stone's
throw and she will have changed his base metal into
gold.
</p>

<p class="p2 center">
CRICKETS
</p>

<p>
The crackling flight of grasshoppers is a luxury; and
pleasant is it when summer has once more followed in
the steps of winter to hear scald cricket piping a Nibelungenlied
in the grass. It is the most infinite of singers.
Wiselier had the Greeks chosen a golden cricket, and
let the grasshopper eat grass. One opens both his ears
to the invisible, incessant quire, and doubts if it be not
earth herself chanting for all time.

GENII

In the vulgar daylight of our self-conceit, good genii are

SPHERE MUSIC
</p>

<p>
<i>Sept. 2.</i> The cocks chant a strain of which we never
tire. Some there are who find pleasure in the melody
of birds and chirping of crickets,—aye, even the peeping
of frogs. Such faint sounds as these are for the most
part heard above the weeping and wailing and gnashing
of teeth which so unhallow the Sabbath among us. The
moan the earth makes is after all a very faint sound,
infinitely inferior in volume to its creakings of joy and
gleeful murmurs; so that we may expect the next balloonist
will rise above the utmost range of discordant
sounds into the region of pure melody. Never so loud
was the wail but it seemed to taper off into a piercing
melody and note of joy, which lingered not amid the
clods of the valley.
</p>

<p class="p2 center">
CREEDS
</p>

<p>
<i>Sept. 3.</i> The only faith that men recognize is a creed.
But the true creed which we unconsciously live by, and
which rather adopts us than we it, is quite different
from the written or preached one. Men anxiously hold
fast to their creed, as to a straw, thinking this does them
good service because their sheet anchor does not drag.<a name='FA_37' id='FA_37' href='#FN_37' class='fnanchor'>[37]</a>

what a piece of wonder a river is,—a huge volume
of matter ceaselessly rolling through the fields and
meadows of this substantial earth, making haste from
the high places, by stable dwellings of men and Egyptian
Pyramids, to its restless reservoir. One would think
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_59" name="Page_59" href="#Page_59">59</a></span>

FLOW OF SPIRITS IN YOUTH
</p>

<p>
<i>Sept. 15.</i> How unaccountable the flow of spirits in
youth. You may throw sticks and dirt into the current,
and it will only rise the higher. Dam it up you may, but
dry it up you may not, for you cannot reach its source.
If you stop up this avenue or that, anon it will come
gurgling out where you least expected and wash away
all fixtures. Youth grasps at happiness as an inalienable
right. The tear does no sooner gush than glisten. Who
shall say when the tear that sprung of sorrow first sparkled
with joy?

ALMA NATURA
</p>

<p>
<i>Sept. 20.</i> It is a luxury to muse by a wall-side in the
sunshine of a September afternoon,—to cuddle down
under a gray stone, and hearken to the siren song of the
cricket. Day and night seem henceforth but accidents,
and the time is always a still eventide, and as the close
of a happy day. Parched fields and mulleins gilded with
the slanting rays are my diet. I know of no word so fit
to express this disposition of Nature as Alma Natura.

COMPENSATION

<p>
<i>Sept. 23.</i> If we will be quiet and ready enough, we
shall find compensation in every disappointment. If
a shower drives us for shelter to the maple grove or the
trailing branches of the pine, yet in their recesses with
microscopic eye we discover some new wonder in the
bark, or the leaves, or the fungi at our feet. We are interested
by some new resource of insect economy, or
the chickadee is more than usually familiar. We can
study Nature's nooks and corners then.<a name='FA_40' id='FA_40' href='#FN_40' class='fnanchor'>[40]</a>

SOME SCRAPS FROM AN ESSAY ON "SOUND AND SILENCE"
WRITTEN IN THE LATTER HALF OF THIS
MONTH,—DECEMBER, 1838<a name='FA_44' id='FA_44' href='#FN_44' class='fnanchor'>[44]</a>
</p>

<p>
As the truest society approaches always nearer to
solitude, so the most excellent speech finally falls into
silence. We go about to find Solitude and Silence, as
though they dwelt only in distant glens and the depths
of the forest, venturing out from these fastnesses at
midnight. Silence <i>was</i>, say we, before ever the world
was, as if creation had displaced her, and were not her
visible framework and foil. It is only favorite dells
that she deigns to frequent, and we dream not that she
is then imported into them when we wend thither, as
Selden's butcher busied himself with looking after his
knife, when he had it in his mouth. For where man is,
there is Silence.
</p>

<p class="p2">
Silence is the communing of a conscious soul with
itself. If the soul attend for a moment to its own infinity,
then and there is silence. She is audible to all
men, at all times, in all places, and if we will we may
always hearken to her admonitions.
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_65" name="Page_65" href="#Page_65">65</a></span>
</p>
<p class="p2">
Silence is ever less strange than noise, lurking amid
the boughs of the hemlock or pine just in proportion
as we find ourselves there. The nuthatch, tapping the
upright trunks by our side, is only a partial spokesman
for the solemn stillness.
</p>

<p class="p2">
She is always at hand with her wisdom, by roadsides
and street corners; lurking in belfries, the cannon's
mouth, and the wake of the earthquake; gathering up
and fondling their puny din in her ample bosom.
</p>

<p class="p2">
Those divine sounds which are uttered to our inward
ear—which are breathed in with the zephyr or reflected
from the lake—come to us noiselessly, bathing
the temples of the soul, as we stand motionless amid the
rocks.
</p>

<p class="p2">
The halloo is the creature of walls and mason work;
the whisper is fittest in the depths of the wood, or by the
shore of the lake; but silence is best adapted to the
acoustics of space.
</p>

<p class="p2">
All sounds are her servants and purveyors, proclaiming
not only that their mistress is, but is a rare
mistress, and earnestly to be sought after. Behind the
most distinct and significant hovers always a more
significant silence which floats it. The thunder is only
our signal gun, that we may know what communion
awaits us. Not its dull sound, but the infinite expansion
of our being which ensues, we praise and unanimously
name sublime.
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_66" name="Page_66" href="#Page_66">66</a></span>
</p>
<p>
All sound is nearly akin to Silence; it is a bubble on
her surface which straightway bursts, an emblem of the
strength and prolificness of the undercurrent. It is a
faint utterance of Silence, and then only agreeable to our
auditory nerves when it contrasts itself with the former.
In proportion as it does this, and is a heightener and intensifier
of the Silence, it is harmony and purest melody.
</p>

<p class="p2">
Every melodious sound is the ally of Silence,—a help
and not a hindrance to abstraction.
</p>

<p class="p2">
Certain sounds more than others have found favor
with the poets only as foils to silence.

ANACREON'S ODE TO THE CICADA<a name='FA_45' id='FA_45' href='#FN_45' class='fnanchor'>[45]</a>
</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<p>We pronounce thee happy, cicada,</p>
<p>For on the tops of the trees,</p>
<p>Sipping a little dew,</p>
<p>Like any king thou singest,</p>
<p>For thine are they all,</p>
<p>Whatever thou seest in the fields,</p>
<p>And whatever the woods bear.</p>
<p>Thou art the friend of the husbandmen,</p>
<p>In no respect injuring any one;</p>
<p>And thou art honored among men,</p>
<p>Sweet prophet of summer.</p>
<p>The Muses love thee,</p>
<p>And Phœbus himself loves thee,</p>
<p>And has given thee a shrill song;
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_67" name="Page_67" href="#Page_67">67</a></span></p>
<p>Age does not wrack thee,</p>
<p>Thou skillful, earth-born, song-loving,</p>
<p>Unsuffering, bloodless one;</p>
<p>Almost thou art like the gods.</p>
</div></div></div>

<p class="p2">
Silence is the universal refuge, the sequel of all dry
discourses and all foolish acts, as balm to our every
chagrin, as welcome after satiety as [after] disappointment;
that background which the painter may not
daub, be he master or bungler, and which, however
awkward a figure he may have made in the foreground,
remains ever our inviolable asylum.
</p>

<p class="p2">
With what equanimity does the silent consider how
his world goes, settles the awards of virtue and justice,
is slandered and buffeted never so much and views it
all as a phenomenon. He is one with Truth, Goodness,
Beauty. No indignity can assail him, no personality
disturb him.
</p>

<p class="p2">
The orator puts off his individuality, and is then most
eloquent when most silent. He listens while he speaks,
and is a hearer along with his audience.
</p>

<p class="p2">
Who has not hearkened to her infinite din? She is
Truth's speaking trumpet, which every man carries
slung over his shoulder, and when he will may apply to
his ear. She is the sole oracle, the true Delphi and
Dodona, which kings and courtiers would do well to
consult, nor will they be balked by an ambiguous answer.
Through her have all revelations been made. Just as
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_68" name="Page_68" href="#Page_68">68</a></span>
far as men have consulted her oracle, they have obtained
a clear insight, and their age been marked for an enlightened
one. But as often as they have gone gadding
abroad to a strange Delphi and her mad priestess, they
have been benighted, and their age Dark or Leaden.—These
are garrulous and noisy eras, which no longer
yield any sound; but the Grecian, or <i>silent</i> and melodious,
Era is ever sounding on the ears of men.
</p>

<p class="p2">
A good book is the plectrum with which our silent
lyres are struck. In all epics, when, after breathless
attention, we come to the significant words "He said,"
then especially our inmost man is addressed. We not
unfrequently refer the interest which belongs to our own
unwritten sequel to the written and comparatively lifeless
page. Of all valuable books this same sequel makes
an indispensable part. It is the author's aim to say once
and emphatically, "He said." This is the most the
bookmaker can attain to. If he make his volume a foil
whereon the waves of silence may break, it is well. It is
not so much the sighing of the blast as that pause, as
Gray expresses it, "when the gust is recollecting itself,"
that thrills us, and is infinitely grander than the importunate
howlings of the storm.
</p>

<p class="p2">
At evening Silence sends many emissaries to me,
some navigating the subsiding waves which the village
murmur has agitated.
</p>

<p class="p2">
It were vain for me to interpret the Silence. She cannot
be done into English. For six thousand years have
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_69" name="Page_69" href="#Page_69">69</a></span>
men translated her, with what fidelity belonged to each;
still is she little better than a sealed book. A man may
run on confidently for a time, thinking he has her under
his thumb, and shall one day exhaust her, but he too
must at last be silent, and men remark only how brave
a beginning he made; for, when he at length dives into
her, so vast is the disproportion of the told to the untold
that the former will seem but the bubble on the surface
where he disappeared.
</p>

<p class="p2">
Nevertheless will we go on, like those Chinese cliff
swallows, feathering our nests with the froth, so they
may one day be bread of life to such as dwell by the
seashore.

THE POET
</p>

<p>
<i>March 3.</i> He must be something more than natural,—even
supernatural. Nature will not speak through
but along with him. His voice will not proceed from her
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_75" name="Page_75" href="#Page_75">75</a></span>
midst, but, breathing on her, will make her the expression
of his thought. He then poetizes when he takes a fact
out of nature into spirit. He speaks without reference to
time or place. His thought is one world, hers another.
He is another Nature,—Nature's brother. Kindly offices
do they perform for one another. Each publishes
the other's truth.
</p>

<p class="p2 center">
MORNING
</p>

<p>
<i>April 4.</i> The atmosphere of morning gives a healthy
hue to our prospects. Disease is a sluggard that overtakes,
never encounters, us. We have the start each day,
and may fairly distance him before the dew is off; but
if we recline in the bowers of noon, he will come up
with us after all. The morning dew breeds no cold. We
enjoy a diurnal reprieve in the beginning of each day's
creation. In the morning we do not believe in expediency;
we will start afresh, and have no patching, no
temporary fixtures. The afternoon man has an interest
in the past; his eye is divided, and he sees indifferently
well either way.
</p>

<p class="p2 center">
DRIFTING
</p>

<p>
Drifting in a sultry day on the sluggish waters of the
pond, I almost cease to live and begin to be. A boatman
stretched on the deck of his craft and dallying with
the noon would be as apt an emblem of eternity for me
as the serpent with his tail in his mouth. I am never so
prone to lose my identity. I am dissolved in the haze.
</p>

<p class="p2 center">
DISAPPOINTMENT
</p>

<p>
<i>April 7. Sunday.</i> The tediousness and detail of execution
never occur to the genius projecting; it always
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_76" name="Page_76" href="#Page_76">76</a></span>
antedates the completion of its work. It condescends
to give time a few hours to do its bidding in.
</p>

<p class="p2 center">
RESOLVE
</p>

<p>
Most have sufficient contempt for what is mean to resolve
that they will abstain from it, and a few virtue enough
to abide by their resolution, but not often does one attain
to such lofty contempt as to require no resolution
to be made.
</p>

<p class="p2 center">
THE TEAMSTER
</p>

<p>
<i>April 8.</i> There goes a six-horse team, and a man by
its side. He has rolled out of his cradle into a Tom-and-Jerry,
and goes about his business while Nature
goes about hers, without standing agape at his condition.
As though sixty years were not enough for these
things! What have death, and the cholera, and the immortal
destiny of man, to do with the shipping interests?
There is an unexplained bravery in this. What with
bare astonishment one would think that man had his
hands full for so short a term. But this is no drawback
on the lace-working and cap-making interests. Some
attain to such a degree of sang-froid and nonchalance
as to be weavers of toilet cushions and manufacturers
of pinheads, without once flinching or the slightest
affection of the nerves, for the period of a natural life.<a name='FA_54' id='FA_54' href='#FN_54' class='fnanchor'>[54]</a>

<p class="p2 center">
FAT PINE FOR SPEARING
</p>

<p>
<i>April 9.</i> Fat roots of pine lying in rich veins as of
gold or silver, even in old pastures where you would
least expect it, make you realize that you live in the
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_77" name="Page_77" href="#Page_77">77</a></span>
youth of the world, and you begin to know the wealth
of the planet. Human nature is still in its prime, then.
Bring axe, pickaxe, and shovel, and tap the earth here
where there is most sap. The marrowy store gleams
like some vigorous sinew, and you feel a new suppleness
in your own limbs. These are the traits that conciliate
man's moroseness, and make him civil to his fellows;
every such pine root is a pledge of suavity. If he can
discover absolute barrenness in any direction there will
be some excuse for peevishness.
</p>

<p class="p2 center">
SOCIETY
</p>

<p>
<i>April 14.</i> There is a <i>terra firma</i> in society as well as
in geography, some whose ports you may make by dead
reckoning in all weather. All the rest are but floating
and fabulous Atlantides which sometimes skirt the western
horizon of our intercourse. They impose only on
seasick mariners who have put into some Canary Island
on the frontiers of society.
</p>

<p class="p2 center">
CIRCUMSTANCES
</p>

<p>
<i>April 24.</i> Why should we concern ourselves with
what has happened to us, and the unaccountable fickleness
of events, and not rather [with] how we have happened
to the universe, and it has demeaned itself in
consequence? Let us record in each case the judgment
we have awarded to circumstances.
</p>

<p class="p2 center">
ACQUAINTANCE
</p>

<p>
Cheap persons will stand upon ceremony, because
there is no other ground; but to the great of the
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_78" name="Page_78" href="#Page_78">78</a></span>
earth we need no introduction, nor do they need any
to us.
</p>

<p class="p2 center">
THE KINGDOMS OF THE EARTH
</p>

<p>
<i>April 25.</i> If we see the reality in things, of what
moment is the superficial and apparent? Take the earth
and all the interests it has known,—what are they
beside one deep surmise that pierces and scatters them?
The independent beggar disposes of all with one hearty,
significant curse by the roadside. 'Tis true they are
not worth a "tinker's damn."
</p>

<p class="p2 center">
PICTURE
</p>

<p>
<i>April 30.</i> Of some illuminated pictures which I saw
last evening, one representing the plain of Babylon,
with only a heap of brick-dust in the centre, and an uninterrupted
horizon bounding the desert, struck me most.
I would see painted a boundless expanse of desert,
prairie, or sea, without other object than the horizon.
The heavens and the earth,—the first and last painting,—where
is the artist who shall undertake it?

<i>May 11.</i> The farmer keeps pace with his crops and
the revolutions of the seasons, but the merchant with the
fluctuations of trade. Observe how differently they walk
in the streets.

VICE AND VIRTUE
</p>

<p>
<i>May 16.</i> Virtue is the very heart and lungs of vice:
it cannot stand up but it lean on virtue.
</p>

<p class="p2">
Who has not admired the twelve labors? And yet
nobody thinks if Hercules had sufficient motive for
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_79" name="Page_79" href="#Page_79">79</a></span>
racking his bones to that degree. Men are not so much
virtuous as patrons of virtue, and every one knows that
it is easier to deal with the real possessor of a thing than
the temporary guardian of it.
</p>

<p class="p2 center">
THE FORM OF STRENGTH
</p>

<p>
<i>May 17.</i> We say justly that the weak person is flat;
for, like all flat substances, he does not stand in the
direction of his strength, that is on his edge, but affords
a convenient surface to put upon. He slides all the way
through life. Most things are strong in one direction,—a
straw longitudinally, a board in the direction of its
edge, a knee transversely to its grain,—but the brave
man is a perfect sphere, which cannot fall on its flat
side, and is equally strong every way. The coward is
wretchedly spheroidal at best, too much educated or
drawn out on one side commonly and depressed on the
other; or he may be likened to a hollow sphere, whose
disposition of matter is best when the greatest bulk is
intended.<a name='FA_55' id='FA_55' href='#FN_55' class='fnanchor'>[55]</a>
</p>

<p class="p2 center">
SELF-CULTURE
</p>

<p>
<i>May 21.</i> Who knows how incessant a surveillance
a strong man may maintain over himself,—how far
subject passion and appetite to reason, and lead the life
his imagination paints? Well has the poet said,—

MY ATTIC
</p>

<p>
<i>June 4.</i> I sit here this fourth of June, looking out on
men and nature from this that I call my perspective
window, through which all things are seen in their true
relations. This is my upper empire, bounded by four
walls, viz., three of boards yellow-washed, facing the
north, west, and south, respectively, and the fourth of
plaster, likewise yellow-washed, fronting the sunrise,—to
say nothing of the purlieus and outlying provinces,
unexplored as yet but by rats.

RENCOUNTER
</p>

<p>
<i>June 22. Saturday.</i> I have within the last few days
come into contact with a pure, uncompromising spirit,
that is somewhere wandering in the atmosphere, but
settles not positively anywhere. Some persons carry
about them the air and conviction of virtue, though
they themselves are unconscious of it, and are even
backward to appreciate it in others. Such it is impossible
not to love; still is their loveliness, as it were, independent
of them, so that you seem not to lose it
when they are absent, for when they are near it is like
an invisible presence which attends you.
</p>

<p>
That virtue we appreciate is as much ours as another's.
We see so much only as we possess.

ANNURSNACK
</p>

<p>
<i>July 11.</i> At length we leave the river and take to
the road which leads to the hilltop, if by any means we
may spy out what manner of earth we inhabit. East,
west, north, and south, it is farm and parish, this world
of ours. One may see how at convenient, eternal intervals
men have settled themselves, without thought for
the universe. How little matters it all they have built
and delved there in the valley! It is after all but a feature
in the landscape. Still the vast impulse of nature
breathes over all. The eternal winds sweep across the
interval <i>to-day</i>, bringing mist and haze to shut out their
works. Still the crow caws from Nawshawtuct to
Annursnack, as no feeble tradesman nor smith may do.
And in all swamps the hum of mosquitoes drowns this
modern hum of industry.

<p class="p2">
<i>Aug. 31.</i> Made seven miles, and moored our boat
on the west side of a little rising ground which in the
spring forms an island in the river, the sun going
down on one hand, and our eminence contributing its
shadow to the night on the other.<a name='FA_61' id='FA_61' href='#FN_61' class='fnanchor'>[61]</a> In the twilight so
elastic is the air that the sky seems to tinkle [<i>sic</i>] over
farmhouse and wood. Scrambling up the bank of our
<i>terra incognita</i> we fall on huckleberries, which have
slowly ripened here, husbanding the juices which the
months have distilled, for our peculiar use this night.<a name='FA_62' id='FA_62' href='#FN_62' class='fnanchor'>[62]</a>
If they had been rank poison, the entire simplicity and
confidence with which we plucked them would have
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_89" name="Page_89" href="#Page_89">89</a></span>
insured their wholesomeness. The devout attitude of
the hour asked a blessing on that repast. It was fit for
the setting sun to rest on.
</p>

<p class="p2">
From our tent here on the hillside, through that
isosceles door, I see our lonely mast on the shore, it may
be as an eternity fixture, to be seen in landscapes henceforth,
or as the most temporary standstill of time, the
boat just come to anchor, and the mast still rocking to
find its balance.<a name='FA_63' id='FA_63' href='#FN_63' class='fnanchor'>[63]</a>

No human life is in night,—the woods, the boat,
the shore,—yet is it lifelike.<a name='FA_64' id='FA_64' href='#FN_64' class='fnanchor'>[64]</a> The warm pulse of a
young life beats steadily underneath all. This slight
wind is where one artery approaches the surface and is
skin deep.

<p class="p2">
While I write here, I hear the foxes trotting about me
over the dead leaves, and now gently over the grass, as
if not to disturb the dew which is falling. Why should
we not cultivate neighborly relations with the foxes?
As if to improve upon our seeming advances, comes
one to greet us nosewise under our tent-curtain. Nor
do we rudely repulse him. Is man powder and the fox
flint and steel? Has not the time come when men and
foxes shall lie down together?
</p>

<p class="p2">
Hist! there, the musquash by the boat is taking
toll of potatoes and melons. Is not this the age of a
community of goods? His presumption kindles in me
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_90" name="Page_90" href="#Page_90">90</a></span>
a brotherly feeling. Nevertheless. I get up to reconnoitre,
and tread stealthily along the shore to make
acquaintance with him. But on the riverside I can see
only the stars reflected in the water, and now, by some
ripple ruffling the disk of a star, I discover him.
</p>

<p class="p2">
In the silence of the night the sound of a distant alarm
bell is borne to these woods. Even now men have fires
and extinguish them, and, with distant horizon blazings
and barking of dogs, enact the manifold drama of life.<a name='FA_65' id='FA_65' href='#FN_65' class='fnanchor'>[65]</a>

We begin to have an interest in sun, moon, and stars.
What time riseth Orion? Which side the pole gropeth

they? What clock shall tell the hours for us?—Billerica,
midnight.

<p>
From Ball's Hill to Billerica meeting-house the river
is a noble stream of water, flowing between gentle hills
and occasional cliffs, and well wooded all the way. It
can hardly be said to flow at all, but rests in the lap of
the hills like a quiet lake. The boatmen call it a dead
stream. For many long reaches you can see nothing
to indicate that men inhabit its banks.<a name='FA_66' id='FA_66' href='#FN_66' class='fnanchor'>[66]</a> Nature seems
to hold a sabbath herself to-day,—a still warm sun on
river and wood, and not breeze enough to ruffle the
water. Cattle stand up to their bellies in the river, and
you think Rembrandt should be here.

THE WISE REST
</p>

<p>
<i>Sept 17.</i> Nature never makes haste; her systems revolve
at an even pace. The bud swells imperceptibly,
without hurry or confusion, as though the short spring
days were an eternity.<a name='FA_75' id='FA_75' href='#FN_75' class='fnanchor'>[75]</a> All her operations seem separately,
for the time, the single object for which all things
tarry. Why, then, should man hasten as if anything less
than eternity were allotted for the least deed? Let him
consume never so many æons, so that he go about the
meanest task well, though it be but the paring of his
nails.<a name='FA_76' id='FA_76' href='#FN_76' class='fnanchor'>[76]</a> If the setting sun seems to hurry him to improve
the day while it lasts, the chant of the crickets fails not
to reassure him, even-measured as of old, teaching him
to take his own time henceforth forever. The wise man
is restful, never restless or impatient. He each moment
abides there where he is, as some walkers actually rest
the whole body at each step, while others never relax the
muscles of the leg till the accumulated fatigue obliges
them to stop short.
</p>

<p>
As the wise is not anxious that time wait for him,
neither does he wait for it.

ÆSCHYLUS
</p>

<p>
<i>Nov. 5.</i> There was one man lived his own healthy
Attic life in those days. The words that have come down
to us evidence that their speaker was a seer in his day
and generation. At this day they owe nothing to their
dramatic form, nothing to stage machinery, and the
fact that they were spoken under these or those circumstances.
All display of art for the gratification of a factitious
taste is silently passed by to come at the least
particle of absolute and genuine thought they contain.
The reader will be disappointed, however, who looks
for traits of a rare wisdom or eloquence, and will have
to solace himself, for the most part, with the poet's
humanity and what it was in him to say. He will discover
that, like every genius, he was a solitary liver and
worker in his day.
</p>

<p>
We are accustomed to say that the common sense of
this age belonged to the seer of the last,—as if time gave
him any vantage ground. But not so: I see not but
Genius must ever take an equal start, and all the generations
of men are virtually at a standstill for it to come
and consider of them. Common sense is not so familiar
with any truth but Genius will represent it in a strange
light to it. Let the seer bring down his broad eye to the
most stale and trivial fact, and he will make you believe
it a new planet in the sky.
</p>

<p>
As to criticism, man has never to make allowance
to man; there is naught to excuse, naught to bear in
mind.
</p>

<p>
All the past is here present to be tried; let it approve
itself if it can.

GROWTH
</p>

<p>
We are not apt to remember that we grow. It is
curious to reflect how the maiden waiteth patiently, confiding
as the unripe houstonia of the meadow, for the
slow moving years to work their will with her,—perfect
and ripen her,—like it to be fanned by the wind,
watered by the rain, and receive her education at the
hands of nature.
</p>

<p>
These young buds of manhood in the streets are like
buttercups in the meadows,—surrendered to nature
as they.
</p>

<p class="p2">
<i>Nov. 7.</i> I was not aware till to-day of a rising and
risen generation. Children appear to me as raw as the
fresh fungi on a fence rail. By what degrees of consanguinity
is this succulent and rank-growing slip of
manhood related to me? What is it but another herb,
ranging all the kingdoms of nature, drawing in sustenance
by a thousand roots and fibres from all soils.

REGRET
</p>

<p>
<i>Nov. 13.</i> Make the most of your regrets; never
smother your sorrow, but tend and cherish it till it come
to have a separate and integral interest. To regret
deeply is to live afresh. By so doing you will be astonished
to find yourself restored once more to all your
emoluments.
</p>

<p class="p2 center">
DESPONDENCY
</p>

<p>
<i>Nov. 14.</i> There is nowhere any apology for despondency.
Always there is life which, rightly lived, implies
a divine satisfaction. I am soothed by the rain-drops
on the door-sill; every globule that pitches thus confidently
from the eaves to the ground is my life insurance.
Disease and a rain-drop cannot coexist. The
east wind is not itself consumptive, but has enjoyed a
rare health from of old. If a fork or brand stand erect,
good is portended by it. They are the warrant of universal
innocence.

BRAVERY
</p>

<p>
<i>Dec. 2.</i> A rare landscape immediately suggests a
suitable inhabitant, whose breath shall be its wind,
whose moods its seasons, and to whom it will always
be fair. To be chafed and worried, and not as serene
as Nature, does not become one whose nature is as steadfast
as she. We do all stand in the front ranks of the
battle every moment of our lives; where there is a brave
man there is the thickest of the fight, there the post of
honor. Not he who procures a substitute to go to Florida
is exempt from service; he gathers his laurels in another
field. Waterloo is not the only battle-ground: as many
and fatal guns are pointed at my breast now as are contained
in the English arsenals.

FROM A CHAPTER ON BRAVERY.—<i>Script</i>
</p>

<p>
<i>Dec.</i> Bravery deals not so much in resolute action,
as in healthy and assured rest. Its palmy state is a
staying at home, and compelling alliance in all directions.<a name='FA_80' id='FA_80' href='#FN_80' class='fnanchor'>[80]</a>
</p>

<p>
The brave man never heareth the din of war; he is
trustful and unsuspecting, so observant of the least trait
of good or beautiful that, if you turn toward him the
dark side of anything, he will still see only the bright.
</p>

<p class="p2">
One moment of serene and confident life is more
glorious than a whole campaign of daring. We should
be ready for all issues, not daring to die but daring to
live. To the brave even danger is an ally.
</p>

<p class="p2">
In their unconscious daily life all are braver than they
know. Man slumbers and wakes in his twilight with
the confidence of noonday; he is not palsied nor struck
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_98" name="Page_98" href="#Page_98">98</a></span>
dumb by the inexplicable riddle of the universe. A mere
surveyor's report or clause in a preëmption bill contains
matter of quite extraneous interest, of a subdued but
confident tone, evincing such a steadiness in the writer
as would have done wonders at Bunker's Hill or Marathon.
Where there is the collected eye, there will not
fail the effective hand; <span lang="gr_GR">χεὶρ δ᾽ ὁρᾷ τὸ δράσιμον</span>.
</p>

<p class="p2">
Science is always brave, for to know is to know good;
doubt and danger quail before her eye. What the coward
overlooks in his hurry, she calmly scrutinizes, breaking
ground like a pioneer for the array of arts in her
train. Cowardice is unscientific, for there cannot be a
science of ignorance. There may be a science of war,
for that advances, but a retreat is rarely well conducted;
if it is, then is it an orderly advance in the face of circumstances.<a name='FA_81' id='FA_81' href='#FN_81' class='fnanchor'>[81]</a>
</p>

<p class="p2">
If his fortune deserts him, the brave man in pity still
abides by her. Samuel Johnson and his friend Savage,
compelled by poverty to pass the night in the streets,
resolve that they will stand by their country.
</p>

<p class="p2">
The state of complete manhood is virtue, and virtue
and bravery are one. This truth has long been in the
languages. All the relations of the subject are hinted
at in the derivation and analogies of the Latin words
<i>vir</i> and <i>virtus</i>, and the Greek <span lang="gr_GR">ἀγαθός</span> and <span lang="gr_GR">ἄριστος</span>. Language
in its settled form is the record of men's second
thoughts, a more faithful utterance than they can momentarily
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_99" name="Page_99" href="#Page_99">99</a></span>
give. What men say is so sifted and obliged
to approve itself as answering to a common want, that
nothing absolutely frivolous obtains currency in the
language. The analogies of words are never whimsical
and meaningless, but stand for real likenesses. Only
the ethics of mankind, and not of any particular man,
give point and vigor to our speech.
</p>

<p class="p2">
The coward was born one day too late, for he has
never overtaken the present hour. He is the younger
son of creation, who now waiteth till the elder decease.<a name='FA_82' id='FA_82' href='#FN_82' class='fnanchor'>[82]</a>
He does not dwell on the earth as though he had a deed
of the land in his pocket,—not as another lump of nature,
as imperturbable an occupant as the stones in the
field. He has only rented a few acres of time and space,
and thinks that every accident portends the expiration
of his lease. He is a non-proprietor, a serf, in his moral
economy nomadic, having no fixed abode. When danger
appears, he goes abroad and clings to straws.
</p>

<p class="p2">
Bravery and Cowardice are kindred correlatives with
Knowledge and Ignorance, Light and Darkness, Good
and Evil.

<p class="p2">
If you let a single ray of light through the shutter, it
will go on diffusing itself without limit till it enlighten
the world, but the shadow that was never so wide at first
as rapidly contracts till it comes to naught. The shadow
of the moon when it passes nearest the sun is lost in
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_100" name="Page_100" href="#Page_100">100</a></span>
space ere it can reach our earth to eclipse it. Always the
<i>system</i> shines with uninterrupted light, for, as the sun is
so much larger than any planet, no shadow can travel
far into space. We may bask always in the light of the
system, always may step back out of the shade. No
man's shadow is as large as his body, if the rays make
a right angle with the reflecting surface. Let our lives be
passed under the equator, with the sun in the meridian.
</p>

<p>
There is no ill which may not be dissipated like the
dark, if you let in a stronger light upon it. Overcome
evil with good. Practice no such narrow economy as they
whose bravery amounts to no more light than a farthing
candle, before which most objects cast a shadow wider
than themselves.<a name='FA_83' id='FA_83' href='#FN_83' class='fnanchor'>[83]</a>

It was a conceit of Plutarch, accounting for the preferences
given to signs observed on the left hand, that
men may have thought "things terrestrial and mortal
directly over against heavenly and divine things, and do
conjecture that the things which to us are on the left
hand, the gods send down from their right hand."<a name='FA_84' id='FA_84' href='#FN_84' class='fnanchor'>[84]</a> If
we are not blind, we shall see how a right hand is
stretched over all, as well the unlucky as lucky, and

When the world is declared under martial law, every
Esau retakes his birthright, and what there is in him
does not fail to appear. He wipes off all old scores and
commences a new account. The world is interested to
know how any soul will demean itself in so novel a position.
But when war too, like commerce and husbandry,
gets to be a routine, and men go about it as indented
apprentices, the hero degenerates into a marine, and
the standing army into a standing jest.

No pains are spared to do honor to the brave soldier.
All guilds and corporations are taxed to provide him
with fit harness and equipment. His coat must be red
as the sunset, or blue as the heavens. Gold or silver,
pinchbeck or copper, solid or superficial, mark him for
fortune's favorite. The skill of a city enchases and tempers
his sword-blade; the Tyrian dye confounds him
with emperors and kings. Wherever he goes, music
precedes and prepares the way for him. His life is a
holiday, and the contagion of his example unhinges the
universe. The world puts by work and comes out to
stare. He is the one only man. He recognizes no time-honored
casts and conventions, no fixtures but transfixtures,
no governments at length settled on a permanent
basis. One tap of the drum sets the political and
moral harmonies all ajar. His ethics may well bear
comparison with the priest's. He may rally, charge,
retreat in an orderly manner, but never flee nor flinch.<a name='FA_87' id='FA_87' href='#FN_87' class='fnanchor'>[87]</a>

The brave man is the sole patron of music;<a name='FA_89' id='FA_89' href='#FN_89' class='fnanchor'>[89]</a> he recognizes
it for his mother-tongue,—a more mellifluous
and articulate language than words, in comparison with
which speech is recent and temporary. It is his voice.
His language must have the same majestic movement
and cadence that philosophy assigns to the heavenly
bodies. The steady flux of his thought constitutes time
in music. The universe falls in and keeps pace with it,
which before proceeded singly and discordant. Hence
are poetry and song. When Bravery first grew afraid
and went to war, it took music along with it. The soul
delighted still to hear the echo of its own voice. Especially
the soldier insists on agreement and harmony
always. Indeed, it is that friendship there is in war that

The brave warrior must have harmony if not melody
at any sacrifice. Consider what shifts he makes. There
are the bagpipe, the gong, the trumpet, the drum,—either
the primitive central African or Indian, or the
brass European. Ever since Jericho fell down before a
blast of rams' horns, the martial and musical have gone
hand in hand. If the soldier marches to the sack of a
town, he must be preceded by drum and trumpet, which
shall as it were identify his cause with the accordant
universe. All woods and walls echo back his own spirit,
and the hostile territory is then preoccupied for him.
He is no longer insulated, but infinitely related and
familiar. The roll-call musters for him all the forces
of nature.<a name='FA_91' id='FA_91' href='#FN_91' class='fnanchor'>[91]</a>

All sounds, and more than all, silence, do fife and

senses and emit a tremulous light, like the aurora

<p class="p2">
To the sensitive soul, the universe has its own fixed
measure, which is its measure also, and, as a regular
pulse is inseparable from a healthy body, so is its
healthiness dependent on the regularity of its rhythm.
In all sounds the soul recognizes its own rhythm, and
seeks to express its sympathy by a correspondent movement
of the limbs. When the body marches to the
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_104" name="Page_104" href="#Page_104">104</a></span>
measure of the soul, then is true courage and invincible
strength.<a name='FA_94' id='FA_94' href='#FN_94' class='fnanchor'>[94]</a>
</p>

<p class="p2">
The coward would reduce this thrilling sphere music
to a universal wail, this melodious chant to a nasal cant.
He thinks to conciliate all hostile influences by compelling
his neighborhood into a partial concord with
himself, but his music is no better than a jingle which
is akin to a jar,—jars regularly recurring.<a name='FA_95' id='FA_95' href='#FN_95' class='fnanchor'>[95]</a>
</p>

<p>
He blows a feeble blast of slender melody, because
nature can have no more sympathy with such a soul
than it has of cheerful melody in itself. Hence hears
he no accordant note in the universe, and is a coward,
or consciously outcast and deserted man. But the
brave man, without drum or trumpet, compels concord
everywhere by the universality and tunefulness of his
soul.<a name='FA_96' id='FA_96' href='#FN_96' class='fnanchor'>[96]</a>

"Take a metallic plate," says Coleridge, "and strew
sand on it; sound a harmonic chord over the sand, and
the grains will whirl about in circles, and other geometrical
figures, all, as it were, depending on some point
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_105" name="Page_105" href="#Page_105">105</a></span>
relatively at rest. Sound a discord, and every grain
will whisk about without any order at all, in no figures,
and with no points of rest." The brave man is such a
point of relative rest, over which the soul sounds ever
a harmonic chord.

Music is either a sedative or a tonic to the soul.<a name='FA_97' id='FA_97' href='#FN_97' class='fnanchor'>[97]</a> I read
that "Plato thinks the gods never gave men music, the
science of melody and harmony, for mere delectation
or to tickle the ear; but that the discordant parts of the
circulations and beauteous fabric of the soul, and that
of it that roves about the body, and many times, for
want of tune and air, breaks forth into many extravagances
and excesses, might be sweetly recalled and
artfully wound up to their former consent and agreement."<a name='FA_98' id='FA_98' href='#FN_98' class='fnanchor'>[98]</a>

By dint of wind and stringed instruments the coward

There are some brave traits related by Plutarch; e. g.:
"Homer acquaints us how Ajax, being to engage in a
single combat with Hector, bade the Grecians pray to
the gods for him; and while they were at their devotions,
he was putting on his armor."
</p>

<p>
On another occasion, a storm arises, "which as soon
as the pilot sees, he falls to his prayers, and invokes
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_106" name="Page_106" href="#Page_106">106</a></span>
his tutelar dæmons, but neglects not in the meantime
to hold to the rudder and let down the main yard."
</p>

<p>
"Homer directs his husbandman, before he either plow
or sow, to pray to the terrestrial Jove and the venerable
Ceres, but with his hand upon the plow-tail."

The Romans "made Fortune surname to Fortitude,"
for fortitude is that alchemy that turns all things to
good fortune. The man of fortitude, whom the Latins
called fortis, is no other than that lucky person whom

may "carry Cæsar and Cæsar's fortune." The brave
man stays at home. For an impenetrable shield, stand

The bravest deed, which for the most part is left quite
out of history, which alone wants the staleness of a deed
done and the uncertainty of a deed doing, is the life of
a great man. To perform exploits is to be temporarily
bold, as becomes a courage that ebbs and flows, the
soul quite vanquished by its own deed subsiding into
indifference and cowardice; but the exploit of a brave

FRIENDSHIP <a name='FA_101' id='FA_101' href='#FN_101' class='fnanchor'>[101]</a>
</p>

<p>
<i>Fall of</i> 1839. Then first I conceive of a true friendship,
when some rare specimen of manhood presents
itself. It seems the mission of such to commend virtue
to mankind, not by any imperfect preaching of her
word, but by their own carriage and conduct. We may
then worship moral beauty without the formality of a
religion.
</p>

<p>
They are some fresher wind that blows, some new
fragrance that breathes. They make the landscape and
the sky for us.
</p>

<p class="p2">
The rules of other intercourse are all inapplicable to
this.
</p>

<p class="p2">
We are one virtue, one truth, one beauty. All nature
is our satellite, whose light is dull and reflected. She is
subaltern to us,—an episode to our poem; but we are
primary, and radiate light and heat to the system.
</p>

<p class="p2">
I am only introduced once again to myself.
</p>

<p class="p2">
Conversation, contact, familiarity are the steps to it
and instruments of it, but it is most perfect when these
are done, and distance and time oppose no barrier.
</p>

<p class="p2">
I need not ask any man to be my friend, more than
the sun the earth to be attracted by him. It is not his
to give, nor mine to receive. I cannot pardon my enemy;
let him pardon himself.
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_108" name="Page_108" href="#Page_108">108</a></span>
</p>
<p class="p2">
Commonly we degrade Love and Friendship by presenting
them under the aspect of a trivial dualism.
</p>

<p class="p2">
What matter a few words more or less with my friend,—with
all mankind;—they will still be my friends in
spite of themselves. Let them stand aloof if they can!
As though the most formidable distance could rob me
of any real sympathy or advantage! No, when such
interests are at stake, time, and distance, and difference
fall into their own places.
</p>

<p class="p2">
But alas! to be actually separated from that parcel
of heaven we call our friend, with the suspicion that
we shall no more meet in nature, is source enough
for all the elegies that ever were written. But the true
remedy will be to recover our friend again piecemeal,
wherever we can find a feature, as Æetes gathered up
the members of his son, which Medea had strewn in
her path.
</p>

<p class="p2">
The more complete our sympathy, the more our
senses are struck dumb, and we are repressed by a
delicate respect, so that to indifferent eyes we are least
his friend, because no vulgar symbols pass between
us. On after thought, perhaps, we come to fear that
we have been the losers by such seeming indifference,
but in truth that which withholds us is the bond between
us.
</p>

<p class="p2">
My friend will be as much better than myself as my
aspiration is above my performance.

<i>Jan. 26.</i> They are like air bubbles on water, hastening
to flow together.
</p>

<p>
History tells of Orestes and Pylades, Damon and
Pythias, but why should not we put to shame those old
reserved worthies by a community of such?
</p>

<p class="p2">
Constantly, as it were through a remote skylight, I
have glimpses of a serene friendship-land, and know
the better why brooks murmur and violets grow.

<p>
This conjunction of souls, like waves which meet and
break, subsides also backward over things, and gives
all a fresh aspect.
</p>

I would live henceforth with some gentle soul such a
life as may be conceived, double for variety, single for
harmony,—two, only that we might admire at our oneness,—one,
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_114" name="Page_114" href="#Page_114">114</a></span>
because indivisible. Such community to
be a pledge of holy living. How could aught unworthy
be admitted into our society? To listen with one ear to
each summer sound, to behold with one eye each summer
scene, our visual rays so to meet and mingle with
the object as to be one bent and doubled; with two
tongues to be wearied, and thought to spring ceaselessly
from a double fountain.

POETRY
</p>

<p>
<i>Jan.</i> No definition of poetry is adequate unless it be
poetry itself. The most accurate analysis by the rarest
wisdom is yet insufficient, and the poet will instantly
prove it false by setting aside its requisitions.<a name='FA_104' id='FA_104' href='#FN_104' class='fnanchor'>[104]</a> It is
indeed all that we do not know.
</p>

<p>
The poet does not need to see how meadows are something
else than earth, grass, and water, but how they are
thus much. He does not need discover that potato
blows are as beautiful as violets, as the farmer thinks,
but only how good potato blows are.
</p>

<p>
The poem is drawn out from under the feet of the
poet, his whole weight has rested on this ground.
</p>

<p>
It has a logic more severe than the logician's.
</p>

<p>
You might as well think to go in pursuit of the rainbow,
and embrace it on the next hill, as to embrace
the whole of poetry even in thought. The best book is
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_115" name="Page_115" href="#Page_115">115</a></span>
only an advertisement of it, such as is sometimes sewed

<i>Jan. 27.</i> What a tame life we are living! How little

and harmonious routine; immediately all parts of
nature consent to it.<a name='FA_106' id='FA_106' href='#FN_106' class='fnanchor'>[106]</a> The sun-dial still points to the
noon mark, and the sun rises and sets for it. The neighbors
are never fatally obstinate when such a scheme is
to be instituted; but forthwith all lend a hand, and ring
the bell, and bring fuel and lights, and put by work
and don their best garments, with an earnest conformity
which matches the operations of nature. There is always
a present and extant life which all combine to uphold,
though its insufficiency is manifest enough.<a name='FA_107' id='FA_107' href='#FN_107' class='fnanchor'>[107]</a> Still the
sing-song goes on.

on the seashore. An ocean there must be, for it washes
our beach.

ÆSCHYLUS
</p>

<p>
The Greeks, as the Southerns generally, expressed
themselves with more facility than we in distinct and
lively images, and as to the grace and completeness with
which they treated the subjects suited to their genius
they must be allowed to retain their ancient supremacy.
But a rugged and uncouth array of thought, though
never so modern, may rout them at any moment. It
remains for other than Greeks to write the literature
of the next century.
</p>

<p>
Æschylus had a clear eye for the commonest things.
His genius was only an enlarged common sense. He
adverts with chaste severity to all natural facts. His
sublimity is Greek sincerity and simpleness, naked
wonder which mythology had not helped to explain.
</p>

<p>
Tydeus' shield had for device
</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<p class="o1">"An artificial heaven blazing with stars;</p>
<p>A bright full moon in the midst of the shield,</p>
<p>Eldest of stars, eye of night, is prominent."</p>
</div></div></div>

<p class="p2">
The Greeks were stern but simple children in their
literature. We have gained nothing by the few ages
which we have the start of them. This universal wondering
at those old men is as if a matured grown person
should discover that the aspirations of his youth argued
a diviner life than the contented wisdom of his manhood.
</p>

<p class="p2">
He is competent to express any of the common manly
feelings. If his hero is to make a boast, it does not lack
fullness, it is as boastful as could be desired; he has a
flexible mouth, and can fill it readily with strong, round
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_117" name="Page_117" href="#Page_117">117</a></span>
words, so that you will say the man's speech wants nothing,
he has left nothing unsaid, but he has actually
wiped his lips of it.
</p>

<p>
Whatever the common eye sees at all and expresses
as best it may, he sees uncommonly and describes with
rare completeness. The multitude that thronged the
theatre could no doubt go along with him to the end.
The Greeks had no transcendent geniuses like Milton
and Shakespeare, whose merit only posterity could fully
appreciate.
</p>

<p class="p2">
The social condition of genius is the same in all ages.
Æschylus was undoubtedly alone and without sympathy
in his simple reverence for the mystery of the
universe.

come to the price of a pearl, that sheweth best by day;
but it will not rise to the price of a diamond or carbuncle,
which sheweth best in varied lights." Like the pearl,
truth shines with a steady but pale light which invites
to introspection; it is intrinsically bright, not accidentally
as the diamond. We seem to behold its rear
always, as though it were not coming toward us but
retiring from us. Its light is not reflected this way, but
we see the sombre and wrong side of its rays. As the
dust in his beams makes known that the sun shines.

Falsehoods that glare and dazzle are sloped toward
us, reflecting full in our faces even the light of the sun.
Wait till sunset, or go round them, and the falsity will
be apparent.
</p>

<p class="p2">
It is never enough that our life is an easy one. We
must live on the stretch; not be satisfied with a tame

"Sit not down in the popular seats and common
level of virtues, but endeavor to make them heroical.

physical encounters, and languish in the mild and even
climate of the tropics, so our souls thrive best on unrest
and discontent.<a name='FA_110' id='FA_110' href='#FN_110' class='fnanchor'>[110]</a>

Knavery is more foolish than folly, for that, half knowing
its own foolishness, it still persists. The knave has
reduced folly to a system, is the prudent, common-sense
fool. The witling has the simplicity and directness of
genius, is the inspired fool. His incomprehensible ravings
become the creed of the dishonest of a succeeding era.

Duty belongs to the understanding, but genius is not
dutiful, the highest talent is dutiful. Goodness results
from the wisest use of talent.

The perfect man has both genius and talent. The
one is his head, the other his foot; by one he is, by the

A very meagre natural history suffices to make me

I fancy I am amphibious and swim in all the brooks
and pools in the neighborhood, with the perch and
bream, or doze under the pads of our river amid the
winding aisles and corridors formed by their stems,
with the stately pickerel. I am the wiser in respect
to all knowledges, and the better qualified for all fortunes,

They are to us instead of the beaver. The wind from

and by its racy freshness advertises us of an unexplored
wildness. Those backwoods are not far off. I am affected
by the sight of their cabins of mud and grass,
raised four or five feet, along the river, as when I read

breaks over the road.

Who would have thought that a few feet might not
have been spared from the trunks of most trees? Such

that depth of water, have a dwarfish appearance. No

<i>Feb. 26.</i> The most important events make no stir on
their first taking place, nor indeed in their effects directly.
They seem hedged about by secrecy. It is concussion,
or the rushing together of air to fill a vacuum,
which makes a noise. The great events to which all
things consent, and for which they have prepared the
way, produce no explosion, for they are gradual, and
create no vacuum which requires to be suddenly filled;
as a birth takes place in silence, and is whispered about
the neighborhood, but an assassination, which is at war
with the constitution of things, creates a tumult immediately.

<i>Feb. 27.</i> Some geniuses seem to hover in the horizon,
like heat lightning, which is not accompanied with fertilizing
rain to us, but we are obliged to rest contented
with the belief that it is purifying the air somewhere.
Others make known their presence by their effects, like
that vivid lightning which is accompanied by copious
rain and thunder and, though it clears our atmosphere,
sometimes destroys our lives. Others still impart a
steady and harmless light at once to large tracts, as the
aurora borealis; and this phenomenon is hardest to be
accounted for, some thinking it to be a reflection of the
polar splendor, others a subtle fluid which pervades all
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_125" name="Page_125" href="#Page_125">125</a></span>

that these are equally electrical phenomena, as some
clever persons have shown by drawing a spark with
their knuckles. Modern philosophy thinks it has drawn
down lightning from the clouds.

The song of the birds is an epithalamium, a hymeneal.
The marriage of the flowers spots the meadows and

the bowels of the earth, this is the employment and
condition of all things.

for them all things have an answer ready. The

but the state of the crops or Brighton market no

<i>March 8.</i> The wind shifts from northeast and east
to northwest and south, and every icicle which has tinkled
on the meadow grass so long trickles down its
stem and seeks its water level unerringly with a million
comrades. In the ponds the ice cracks with a busy and
inspiriting din and down the larger streams is whirled,
grating hoarsely and crashing its way along, which
was so lately a firm field for the woodman's team and
the fox, sometimes with the tracks of the skaters still
fresh upon it, and the holes cut for pickerel. Town
committees inspect the bridges and causeways, as if
by mere eye-force to intercede with the ice and save
the treasury.
</p>

<p>
In the brooks the slight grating sound of small cakes
of ice, floating with various speed, is full of content and
promise, and where the water gurgles under a natural
bridge, you may hear these hasty rafts hold conversation
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_127" name="Page_127" href="#Page_127">127</a></span>
in an undertone. Every rill is a channel for the
juices of the meadow.<a name='FA_120' id='FA_120' href='#FN_120' class='fnanchor'>[120]</a> Last year's grasses and flower-stalks
have been steeped in rain and snow, and now the

In the ponds the sun makes incroachments around
the edges first, as ice melts in a kettle on the fire, darting
his rays through this crevice, and preparing the
deep water to act simultaneously on the under side.

The ducks alight at this season on the windward side
of the river, in the smooth water, and swim about by
twos and threes, pluming themselves and diving to peck
at the root of the lily and the cranberries which the frost
has not loosened. It is impossible to approach them
within gunshot when they are accompanied by the gull,
which rises sooner and makes them restless. They fly
to windward first, in order to get under weigh, and are
more easily reached by the shot if approached on that
side. When preparing to fly, they swim about with
their heads erect, and then, gliding along a few feet
with their bodies just touching the surface, rise heavily
with much splashing and fly low at first, if not suddenly
aroused, but otherwise rise directly to survey the danger.
The cunning sportsman is not in haste to desert

be a mail-carrier in Peru, or a South African planter,
or a Siberian exile, or a Greenland whaler, or a settler
on the Columbia River, or a Canton merchant, or a soldier

I am freer than any planet; no complaint reaches
round the world. I can move away from public opinion,

Massachusetts, or figs and olives in Asia Minor? sit
out the day in my office in State Street, or ride it out
on the steppes of Tartary? For my Brobdingnag I may
sail to Patagonia; for my Lilliput, to Lapland. In
Arabia and Persia, my day's adventures may surpass
the Arabian Nights' Entertainments. I may be a logger
on the head waters of the Penobscot, to be recorded
in fable hereafter as an amphibious river-god, by as
sounding a name as Triton or Proteus; carry furs from
Nootka to China, and so be more renowned than Jason
and his golden fleece; or go on a South Sea exploring
expedition, to be hereafter recounted along with the
periplus of Hanno. I may repeat the adventures of
Marco Polo or Mandeville.

Thank Fortune, we are not rooted to the soil, and
here is not all the world. The buckeye does not grow

of birds? Shall we not compete with the buffalo,
who keeps pace with the seasons, cropping the pastures
of the Colorado till a greener and sweeter grass awaits

us migrate interiorly without intermission, and pitch
our tent each day nearer the western horizon. The

A long, soaking rain, the drops trickling down the stubble,
while I lay drenched on a last year's bed of wild
oats, by the side of some bare hill, ruminating. These
things are of moment. To watch this crystal globe just
sent from heaven to associate with me. While these
clouds and this sombre drizzling weather shut all in,
we two draw nearer and know one another. The gathering
in of the clouds with the last rush and dying
breath of the wind, and then the regular dripping of
twigs and leaves the country o'er, the impression of
inward comfort and sociableness, the drenched stubble
and trees that drop beads on you as you pass, their
dim outline seen through the rain on all sides drooping
in sympathy with yourself. These are my undisputed
territory. This is Nature's English comfort. The birds
draw closer and are more familiar under the thick foliage,

An early morning walk is a blessing for the whole
day. To my neighbors who have risen in mist and rain
I tell of a clear sunrise and the singing of birds as some
traditionary mythus. I look back to those fresh but now
remote hours as to the old dawn of time, when a solid
and blooming health reigned and every deed was simple
and heroic.

<i>April 22.</i> Thales was the first of the Greeks who

<i>May 14.</i> A kind act or gift lays us under obligation
not so much to the giver as to Truth and Love. We
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_135" name="Page_135" href="#Page_135">135</a></span>
must then be truer and kinder ourselves. Just in proportion
to our sense of the kindness, and pleasure at it,
is the debt paid. What is it to be <i>grateful</i> but to be
<i>gratified</i>,—to be <i>pleased</i>? The nobly poor will dissolve
all obligations by nobly accepting a kindness.
</p>

<p class="p2">
If we are not sensible of kindness, then indeed we
incur a debt. Not to be pleased by generous deeds at
any time, though done to another, but to sit crabbedly
silent in a corner, what is it but a voluntary imprisonment
for debt? It is to see the world through a grating.
Not to let the light of virtuous actions shine on us at all
times, through every crevice, is to live in a dungeon.

War is the sympathy of concussion. We would fain
rub one against another. Its rub may be friction merely,
but it would rather be titillation. We discover in the
quietest scenes how faithfully war has copied the moods
of peace. Men do not peep into heaven but they see
embattled hosts there. Milton's heaven was a camp.
When the sun bursts through the morning fog I seem
to hear the din of war louder than when his chariot
thundered on the plains of Troy. Every man is a warrior
when he aspires. He marches on his post. The
soldier is the practical idealist; he has no sympathy
with matter, he revels in the annihilation of it. So do
we all at times. When a freshet destroys the works of
man, or a fire consumes them, or a Lisbon earthquake
shakes them down, our sympathy with persons is swallowed
up in a wider sympathy with the universe. A
crash is apt to grate agreeably on our ears.

<i>June 11.</i> We had appointed Saturday, August 31st,
1839, for the commencement of our White Mountain
expedition. We awake to a warm, drizzling rain which
threatens delay to our plans, but at length the leaves
and grass are dried, and it comes out a mild afternoon,
of such a sober serenity and freshness that Nature herself
seems maturing some greater scheme of her own.
All things wear the aspect of a fertile idleness. It is the
eventide of the soul. After this long dripping and oozing
from every pore Nature begins to respire again more
healthily than ever. So with a vigorous shove we launch
our boat from the bank, while the flags and bulrushes
curtsy a God-speed, and drop silently down the stream.<a name='FA_125' id='FA_125' href='#FN_125' class='fnanchor'>[125]</a>
As if we had launched our bark in the sluggish current
of our thoughts, and were bound nowhither.
</p>

<p>
Gradually the village murmur subsides, as when one
falls into a placid dream and on its Lethe tide is floated
from the past into the future, or as silently as fresh
thoughts awaken us to new morning or evening light.<a name='FA_126' id='FA_126' href='#FN_126' class='fnanchor'>[126]</a>
</p>

<p>
Our boat<a name='FA_127' id='FA_127' href='#FN_127' class='fnanchor'>[127]</a> was built like a fisherman's dory, with
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_137" name="Page_137" href="#Page_137">137</a></span>
thole-pins for four oars. Below it was green with a
border of blue, as if out of courtesy [to] the green sea
and the blue heavens. It was well calculated for service,
but of consequence difficult to be dragged over
shoal places or carried round falls.
</p>

<p>
A boat should have a sort of life and independence
of its own. It is a sort of amphibious animal, a creature
of two elements, a fish to swim and a bird to fly, related
by one half of its structure to some swift and shapely
fish and by the other to some strong-winged and graceful
bird. The fins of the fish will tell where to set the
oars, and the tail give some hint for the form and position
of the rudder. And so may we learn where there
should be the greatest breadth of beam and depth in
the hold. The bird will show how to rig and trim
the sails, and what form to give to the prow, that it
may balance the boat and divide the air and water
best.
</p>

<p>
The boat took to the water; from of old there had
been a tacit league struck between these two, and now
it gladly availed itself of the old law that the heavier
shall float the lighter.
</p>

<p>
Two masts we had provided, one to serve for a tent-pole
at night, and likewise other slender poles, that we
might exchange the tedium of rowing for poling in
shallow reaches. At night we lay on a buffalo-skin
under a tent of drilled cotton eight feet high and as
many in diameter, which effectually defended from
dampness, so short a step is it from tiled roofs to drilled
cotton, from carpeted floors to a buffalo-skin.<a name='FA_128' id='FA_128' href='#FN_128' class='fnanchor'>[128]</a>

We stole noiselessly down the stream, occasionally
driving a pickerel from the covert of the pads, or a bream

and then sail away on sluggish wings from some recess
of the shore.<a name='FA_131' id='FA_131' href='#FN_131' class='fnanchor'>[131]</a> With its patient study by rocks and sandy
capes, has it wrested the whole of her secret from Nature
yet? It has looked out from its dull eye for so long,
standing on one leg, on moon and stars sparkling
through silence and dark, and now what a rich experience
is its! What says it of stagnant pools, and reeds,
and damp night fogs? It would be worth while to look
in the eye which has been open and seeing at such hours
and in such solitudes. When I behold that dull yellowish
green, I wonder if my own soul is not a bright, invisible
green. I would fain lay my eye side by side with its
and learn of it.<a name='FA_132' id='FA_132' href='#FN_132' class='fnanchor'>[132]</a>

<i>June 15.</i> I stood by the river to-day considering the
forms of the elms reflected in the water. For every oak
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_140" name="Page_140" href="#Page_140">140</a></span>
and birch, too, growing on the hilltop, as well as for
elms and willows, there is a graceful ethereal tree making
down from the roots, as it were the original idea of
the tree, and sometimes Nature in high tides brings her
mirror to its foot and makes it visible.<a name='FA_136' id='FA_136' href='#FN_136' class='fnanchor'>[136]</a> Anxious Nature
sometimes reflects from pools and puddles the objects
which our grovelling senses may fail to see relieved
against the sky with the pure ether for background.

<p>
It would be well if we saw ourselves as in perspective
always, impressed with distinct outline on the sky, side
by side with the shrubs on the river's brim. So let our
life stand to heaven as some fair, sunlit tree against the
western horizon, and by sunrise be planted on some
eastern hill to glisten in the first rays of the dawn.

Why always insist that men incline to the moral side of
their being? Our life is not all moral. Surely, its actual
phenomena deserve to be studied impartially. The science
of Human Nature has never been attempted, as the
science of Nature has. The dry light has never shone on
it. Neither physics nor metaphysics have touched it.

We have not yet met with a sonnet, genial and affectionate,
to prophane swearing, breaking on the still
night air, perhaps, like the hoarse croak of some bird.
Noxious weeds and stagnant waters have their lovers,
and the utterer of oaths must have honeyed lips, and
be another Attic bee after a fashion, for only prevalent
and essential harmony and beauty can employ the laws

long afternoon was like a clear drop of dew with the
heavens and the landscape reflected in it. And as evening
drew on, faint purple clouds began to be reflected
in its water, and the cow-bells tinkled louder and more
incessantly on the banks, and like shy water-rats we

Would it not be a luxury to stand up to one's chin
in some retired swamp for a whole summer's day, scenting
the sweet-fern and bilberry blows, and lulled by the
minstrelsy of gnats and mosquitoes? A day passed in
the society of those Greek sages, such as described in
the "Banquet" of Xenophon, would not be comparable
with the dry wit of decayed cranberry vines, and the
fresh Attic salt of the moss beds. Say twelve hours of
genial and familiar converse with the leopard frog.
The sun to rise behind alder and dogwood, and climb
buoyantly to his meridian of three hands' breadth, and
finally sink to rest behind some bold western hummock.
To hear the evening chant of the mosquito from a thousand
green chapels, and the bittern begin to boom from
his concealed fort like a sunset gun! Surely, one may
as profitably be soaked in the juices of a marsh for
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_142" name="Page_142" href="#Page_142">142</a></span>

I am pleased to see the landscape through the bottom
of a tumbler, it is clothed in such a mild, quiet light,
and the barns and fences checker and partition it with
new regularity. These rough and uneven fields stretch
away with lawn-like smoothness to the horizon. The
clouds are finely distinct and picturesque, the light-blue
sky contrasting with their feathery whiteness. They
are fit drapery to hang over Persia.<a name='FA_140' id='FA_140' href='#FN_140' class='fnanchor'>[140]</a> The smith's shop,

such gardens as he imagines who has schemes of ornamental
husbandry.

we. There are many degrees of warmth below blood

If we only see clearly enough how mean our lives
are, they will be splendid enough. Let us remember
not to strive upwards too long, but sometimes drop
plumb down the other way, and wallow in meanness.
From the deepest pit we may see the stars, if not the
sun. Let us have presence of mind enough to sink when
we can't swim. At any rate, a carcass had better lie on
the bottom than float an offense to all nostrils. It will
not be falling, for we shall ride wide of the earth's gravity
as a star, and always be drawn upward still,—<i><span lang="la">semper

not accessible by the upper road, men would not find
out a lower. Sometimes I feel so cheap that I am inspired,

I cannot, for I am no longer mean. Let me know
that I am ailing, and I am well. We should not always

to welcome and cherish it. Water the weed till it

<i>June 24.</i> When I read Cudworth I find I can tolerate
all,—atomists, pneumatologists, atheists, and theists,—Plato,
Aristotle, Leucippus, Democritus, and Pythagoras.
It is the attitude of these men, more than any
communication, which charms me. It is so rare to find
a man musing. But between them and their commentators
there is an endless dispute. But if it come to that,
that you compare notes, then you are all wrong. As it
is, each takes me up into the serene heavens, and paints
earth and sky. Any sincere thought is irresistible; it
lifts us to the zenith, whither the smallest bubble rises
as surely as the largest.
</p>

<p>
Dr. Cudworth does not consider that the belief in
a deity is as great a heresy as exists. Epicurus held
that the gods were "of human form, yet were so thin
and subtile, as that, comparatively with our terrestrial
bodies, they might be called incorporeal; they having
not so much <i>carnem</i> as <i>quasi-carnem</i>, nor <i>sanguinem</i> as
<i>quasi-sanguinem</i>, a certain kind of aerial or ethereal
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_151" name="Page_151" href="#Page_151">151</a></span>

"romantical," is plainly as good doctrine as his own.
As if any sincere thought were not the best sort of
truth!

on me like a faint presentiment of morning when I am

of smoke is rising from the woods yonder, to uphold
heaven's roof till the light comes again. The landscape,

<i>June 30.</i> I sailed from Fair Haven last evening as
gently and steadily as the clouds sail through the atmosphere.
The wind came blowing blithely from the
southwest fields, and stepped into the folds of our sail
like a winged horse, pulling with a strong and steady
impulse. The sail bends gently to the breeze, as swells
some generous impulse of the heart, and anon flutters
and flaps with a kind of human suspense. I could watch
the motions of a sail forever, they are so rich and full
of meaning. I watch the play of its pulse, as if it were
my own blood beating there. The varying temperature
of distant atmospheres is graduated on its scale. It is a
free, buoyant creature, the bauble of the heavens and
the earth. A gay pastime the air plays with it. If it swells
and tugs, it is because the sun lays his windy finger on
it. The breeze it plays with has been outdoors so long.
So thin is it, and yet so full of life; so noiseless when it
labors hardest, so noisy and impatient when least serviceable.<a name='FA_158' id='FA_158' href='#FN_158' class='fnanchor'>[158]</a>

bugle and drum and fife attempered to the season. It

their medium than mediocrity.

The brave man, while he observes strictly this golden
mean, seems to run through all extremes with impunity;
like the sun, which now appears in the zenith, now in the

they announce no particular truth, they are yet central
to all truth. They are like those examples by which we

We know men through their eyes. You might say
that the eye was always original and unlike another.
It is the feature of the individual, and not of the family,—in
twins still different. All a man's privacy is in his
eye, and its expression he cannot alter more than he
can alter his character. So long as we look a man in
the eye, it seems to rule the other features, and make
them, too, original. When I have mistaken one person
for another, observing only his form, and carriage, and
inferior features, the unlikeness seemed of the least
consequence; but when I caught his eye, and my doubts
were removed, it seemed to pervade every feature.
</p>

<p>
The eye revolves on an independent pivot which we
can no more control than our own will. Its axle is the
axle of the soul, as the axis of the earth is coincident
with the axis of the heavens.

<i>July 11.</i> The true art is not merely a sublime consolation
and holiday labor which the gods have given
to sickly mortals, to be wrought at in parlors, and not
in stithies amid soot and smoke, but such a masterpiece
as you may imagine a dweller on the table-lands
of Central Asia might produce, with threescore and ten
years for canvas, and the faculties of a man for tools,—a
human life, wherein you might hope to discover more
than the freshness of Guido's Aurora, or the mild light
of Titian's landscapes; not a bald imitation or rival of
Nature, but the restored original of which she is the
reflection. For such a work as this, whole galleries of

It is the man determines what is said, not the words.
If a mean person uses a wise maxim, I bethink me how
it can be interpreted so as to commend itself to his meanness;
but if a wise man makes a commonplace remark,
I consider what wider construction it will admit. When
Pittacus says, "It is necessary to accommodate one's
self to the time and take advantage of the occasion," I
assent. He might have considered that to accommodate
one's self to all times, and take advantage of all
occasions, was really to be independent, and make our

countenance, as the haze in October days. When I am
vexed I only ask to be left alone with it. Leave me to my
fate. It is the bosom of time and the lap of eternity;
since to be necessary is to be needful, it is only another
name for inflexibility of good. How I welcome my grim
fellow and aspire to be such a necessity as he! He is so
flexible, and yields to me as the air to my body! I leap
and dance in his midst, and play with his beard till he
smiles. I greet thee, my elder brother, who with thy

A wise man will always have his duds picked up, and
be ready for whatever may happen, as the prudent merchant,
notwithstanding the lavish display of his wares,
will yet have them packed or easy to be removed in
emergencies. In this sense there is something sluttish
in all finery. When I see a fine lady or gentleman dressed
to the top of the fashion, I wonder what they would
do if an earthquake should happen, or a fire suddenly
break out, for they seem to have counted only on fair
weather, and that things will go on smoothly and without
jostling. Those curls and jewels, so nicely adjusted,

Our dress should be such as will hang conveniently

the partner of his guilt. If you suspect me you will
never see me, but all our intercourse will be the politest
leave-taking; I shall constantly defer and apologize,
and postpone myself in your presence. The self-defender
is accursed in the sight of gods and men; he is
a superfluous knight, who serves no lady in the land.
He will find in the end that he has been fighting windmills,
and battered his mace to no purpose. The injured
man with querulous tone resisting his fate is like
a tree struck by lightning, which rustles its sere leaves
the winter through, not having vigor enough [to] cast
them off.

<p>
As for apologies, I must be off with the dew and the

frost, and leave mankind to repair the damage with

Resistance is a very wholesome and delicious morsel
at times. When Venus advanced against the Greeks
with resistless valor, it was by far the most natural attitude
into which the poet could throw his hero to make
him resist heroically. To a devil one might yield gracefully,
but a god would be a worthy foe, and would pardon
the affront.

<p class="p2">
It would be worth while, once for all, fairly and

Let your mood determine the form of salutation, and
approach the creature with a natural nonchalance, as
though he were anything but what he is, and you were
anything but what you are,—as though he were he,
and you were you; in short, as though he were so insignificant
that it did not signify, and so important that
it did not import. Depend upon it, the timber is well
seasoned and tough, and will bear rough usage; and if
it should crack, there is plenty more where it came
from. I am no piece of china-ware that cannot be jostled
against my neighbor, without danger of rupture from
the collision, and must needs ring a scrannel strain to
the end of my days when once I am cracked; but rather
one of the old-fashioned wooden trenchers, which one
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_180" name="Page_180" href="#Page_180">180</a></span>
while stands at the head of the table, and at another is
a milking-stool, and at another a seat for children, and
finally goes down to its grave not unadorned with honorable
scars, and does not die till it is <i>worn</i> out. Use
me, for I am useful in my way. I stand as one of many
petitioners, from toadstool and henbane up to dahlia
and violet, supplicating to be put to my use, if by any
means ye may find me serviceable; whether for a medicated
drink or bath, as balm and lavender; or for fragrance,
as verbena and geranium; or for sight, as cactus;
or for thoughts, as pansy.<a name='FA_200' id='FA_200' href='#FN_200' class='fnanchor'>[200]</a>

<p class="p2">
<i>Jan. 29.</i> There is something proudly thrilling in the
thought that this obedience to conscience and trust in
God, which is so solemnly preached in extremities and
arduous circumstances, is only to retreat to one's self,
and rely on our own strength. In trivial circumstances
I find myself sufficient to myself, and in the most momentous
I have no ally but myself, and must silently
put by their harm by my own strength, as I did the
former. As my own hand bent aside the willow in my
path, so must my single arm put to flight the devil and
his angels. God is not our ally when we shrink, and
neuter when we are bold. If by trusting in God you
lose any particle of your vigor, trust in Him no longer.
When you trust, do not lay aside your armor, but put
it on and buckle it tighter. If by reliance on the gods
I have disbanded one of my forces, then was it poor
policy. I had better have retained the most inexperienced
tyro who had straggled into the camp, and let go
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_181" name="Page_181" href="#Page_181">181</a></span>
the heavenly alliance. I cannot afford to relax discipline
because God is on my side, for He is on the side
of discipline. And if the gods were only the heavens I
fought under, I would not care if they stormed or were
calm. I do not want a countenance, but a help. And
there is more of God and divine help in a man's little
finger than in idle prayer and trust.
</p>

<p class="p2">
The best and bravest deed is that which the whole
man—heart, lungs, hands, fingers, and toes—at any
time prompts. Each hanger-on in the purlieus of the
camp, must strike his standard at the signal from the
Prætorian tent, and fall into the line of march; but if a
single sutler delay to make up his pack, then suspect
the fates and consult the omens again. This is the
meaning of integrity; this is to be an integer, and not a
fraction. Be even for all virtuous ends, but odd for all
vice. Be a perfect power, so that any of your roots
multiplied into itself may give the whole again.
</p>

Beauty is compared, not measured, for it is the creature
of proportions, not of size. Size must be subdued
to it. It is hard for a tall or a short person to be beautiful.

Friends will have to be introduced each time they
meet. They will be eternally strange to one another,
and when they have mutually appropriated their value
for the last hour, they will go and gather a new measure
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_182" name="Page_182" href="#Page_182">182</a></span>
of strangeness for the next. They are like two boughs
crossed in the wood, which play backwards and forwards
upon one another in the wind, and only wear
into each other, but never the sap of the one flows into
the pores of the other, for then the wind would no more
draw from them those strains which enchanted the
wood. They are not two united, but rather one divided.

Of all strange and unaccountable things this journalizing
is the strangest. It will allow nothing to be
predicated of it; its good is not good, nor its bad bad.
If I make a huge effort to expose my innermost and
richest wares to light, my counter seems cluttered with
the meanest homemade stuffs; but after months or
years I may discover the wealth of India, and whatever
rarity is brought overland from Cathay, in that
confused heap, and what perhaps seemed a festoon of
dried apple or pumpkin will prove a string of Brazilian
diamonds, or pearls from Coromandel.

Men lie behind the barrier of a relation as effectually
concealed as the landscape by a mist; and when at

I saw the sun on the hillside. They lie out before me
like a new order of things. As, when the master meets
his pupil as a man, then first do we stand under the same
heavens, and master and pupil alike go down the resistless
ocean stream together.

<i>Jan. 30. Saturday.</i> Far over the fields, between the
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_183" name="Page_183" href="#Page_183">183</a></span>
tops of yonder wood, I see a slight cloud not larger than
the vapor from a kettle, drifting by its own inward
purpose in a direction contrary to the planet. As it flits
across the dells and defiles of the tree-tops, now seen,
then lost beyond a pine, I am curious to know wherein
its will resides, for to my eye it has no heart, nor lungs,
nor brain, nor any interior and private chamber which
it may inhabit.
</p>

<p>
Its motion reminds me of those lines of Milton:—
</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<p class="o1">"As when far off at sea a fleet descried</p>
<p>Hangs in the clouds, by equinoctial winds</p>
<p>Close sailing from Bengala, or the isles</p>
<p>Of Ternate and Tidore, whence merchants bring</p>
<p>Their spicy drugs; they on the trading flood,</p>
<p>Ply stemming nightly toward the pole."</p>
</div></div></div>

<p>
The snow collects upon the plumes of the pitch pine
in the form of a pineapple, which if you divide in the
middle will expose three red kernels like the tamarind-stone.
So does winter with his mock harvest jeer at the
sincerity of summer. The tropical fruits, which will
not bear the rawness of our summer, are imitated in a
thousand fantastic shapes by the whimsical genius of
winter.
</p>

<p class="p2">
In winter the warmth comes directly from the sun,
and is not radiated from the earth. In summer I forget
to bless the sun for his heat; but when I feel his
beams on my back as I thread some snowy dale, I am
grateful as for a special kindness which would not be
weary of well doing but had pursued me even into that
by-place.
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_184" name="Page_184" href="#Page_184">184</a></span>
</p>
<p class="p2">
When the wind blows, the fine snow comes filtering
down through all the aisles of the wood in a golden
cloud.
</p>

<p class="p2">
The trees covered with snow admit a very plain and
clean light, but not brilliant, as if through windows of
ground glass; a sort of white darkness it is, all of the
sun's splendor that can be retained.
</p>

<p class="p2">
The fashions of the wood are more fluctuating than
those of Paris; snow, rime, ice, green and dry leaves
incessantly make new patterns. There are all the shapes
and hues of the kaleidoscope and the designs and ciphers
of books of heraldry in the outlines of the trees.
Every time I see a nodding pine-top, it seems as if a
new fashion of wearing plumes had come into vogue.
</p>

<p class="p2">
I saw a team come out of a path in the woods, as
though it had never gone in, but belonged there, and
only came out like Elisha's bears. It was wholly of the
village, and not at all of the wood.
</p>

<p class="p2">
These particles of snow which the early wind shakes
down are what is stirring, or the morning news of the
wood. Sometimes it is blown up above the trees, like the
sand of the desert.
</p>

<p class="p2">
You glance up these paths, closely imbowered by
bent trees, as through the side aisles of a cathedral,
and expect to hear a choir chanting from their depths.
You are never so far in them as they are far before you.
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_185" name="Page_185" href="#Page_185">185</a></span>
Their secret is where you are not and where your feet
can never carry you.

<p class="p2">
I tread in the tracks of the fox which has gone before
me by some hours, or which perhaps I have started,
with such a tiptoe of expectation as if I were on the trail
of the Spirit itself which resides in these woods, and expected
soon to catch it in its lair.<a name='FA_201' id='FA_201' href='#FN_201' class='fnanchor'>[201]</a>
</p>

<p class="p2">
The snow falls on no two trees alike, but the forms
it assumes are as various as those of the twigs and leaves
which receive it. They are, as it were, predetermined
by the genius of the tree. So one divine spirit descends
alike on all, but bears a peculiar fruit in each. The
divinity subsides on all men, as the snowflakes settle on
the fields and ledges and takes the form of the various
clefts and surfaces on which it lodges.
</p>

<p class="p2">
Here is the distinct trail of a fox stretching [a] quarter
of a mile across the pond. Now I am curious to know
what has determined its graceful curvatures, its greater
or less spaces and distinctness, and how surely they
were coincident with the fluctuations of some mind,
why they now lead me two steps to the right, and then
three to the left. If these things are not to be called up
and accounted for in the Lamb's Book of Life, I shall
set them down for careless accountants. Here was one
expression of the divine mind this morning. The pond
was his journal, and last night's snow made a <i>tabula
rasa</i> for him. I know which way a mind wended this
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_186" name="Page_186" href="#Page_186">186</a></span>
morning, what horizon it faced, by the setting of these
tracks; whether it moved slowly or rapidly, by the
greater or less intervals and distinctness, for the swiftest
step leaves yet a lasting trace.<a name='FA_202' id='FA_202' href='#FN_202' class='fnanchor'>[202]</a>

<p class="p2">
Sometimes I come out suddenly upon a high plain,
which seems to be the upper level and true surface of
the earth, and by its very baldness aspires and lies up
nearer to the stars,—a place where a decalogue might
be let down or a saint translated.
</p>

<p class="p2">
I take a horse and oxen, standing among the wood-piles
in the forest, for one of them, and when at length
the horse pricks his ears, and I give him another name,
where's the difference? I am startled by the possibility
of such errors, and the indifference with [which] they
are allowed to occur.
</p>

<p class="p2">
Fair Haven Pond is <i>scored</i> with the trails of foxes, and
you may see where they have gambolled and gone
through a hundred evolutions, which testify to a singular
listlessness and leisure in nature.
</p>

<p>
Suddenly, looking down the river, I saw a fox some
sixty rods off, making across to the hills on my left. As
the snow lay five inches deep, he made but slow progress,
but it was no impediment to me. So, yielding
to the instinct of the chase, I tossed my head aloft and
bounded away, snuffing the air like a fox-hound, and
spurning the world and the Humane Society at each
bound. It seemed the woods rang with the hunter's
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_187" name="Page_187" href="#Page_187">187</a></span>
horn, and Diana and all the satyrs joined in the chase
and cheered me on. Olympian and Elean youths were
waving palms on the hills. In the meanwhile I gained
rapidly on the fox; but he showed a remarkable presence
of mind, for, instead of keeping up the face of the
hill, which was steep and unwooded in that part, he
kept along the slope in the direction of the forest, though
he lost ground by it. Notwithstanding his fright, he
took no step which was not beautiful. The course on
his part was a series of most graceful curves. It was a
sort of leopard canter, I should say, as if he were nowise
impeded by the snow, but were husbanding his
strength all the while. When he doubled I wheeled and
cut him off, bounding with fresh vigor, and Antæus-like,
recovering my strength each time I touched the
snow. Having got near enough for a fair view, just as
he was slipping into the wood, I gracefully yielded him
the palm. He ran as though there were not a bone in
his back, occasionally dropping his muzzle to the snow
for a rod or two, and then tossing his head aloft when
satisfied of his course. When he came to a declivity he
put his fore feet together and slid down it like a cat. He
trod so softly that you could not have heard it from any
nearness, and yet with such expression that it would
not have been quite inaudible at any distance. So, hoping
this experience would prove a useful lesson to him,
I returned to the village by the highway of the river.<a name='FA_203' id='FA_203' href='#FN_203' class='fnanchor'>[203]</a>

There is all the romance of my youthfulest moment

is nothing so wild and extravagant that it does not make
true. It makes a dream my only real experience, and
prompts faith to such elasticity that only the incredible
can satisfy it. It tells me again to trust the remotest and
finest, as the divinest, instinct. All that I have imagined
of heroism, it reminds and reassures me of. It is a life
unlived, a life beyond life, where at length my years will
pass. I look under the lids of Time.

<i>Jan. 31. Sunday.</i> At each step man measures himself
against the system. If he cannot actually belay
the sun and make it fast to this planet, yet the British
man alone spins a yarn in one year which will reach
fifty-one times the distance from the earth to the
sun. So, having his cable ready twisted and coiled, the
fixed stars are virtually within his grasp. He carries
his lasso coiled at his saddle bow, but is never forced
to cast it.
</p>

<p>
All things are subdued to me by virtue of that coiled
lasso I carry, and I lead them without the trouble of a
cast. It is the rope that lies coiled on the deck, which
moors my ship, and I have never to bend a cable.
</p>

<p>
In God's hall hang cables of infinite length, and in
His entries stand bars of infinite strength; but those
cables were never bent, nor those bars ever poised, for
all things have been subdued to the divinity from the
first, and these are the seals of His power.

The guilty never escape, for a steed stands ever ready

<i>Feb. 2. Tuesday.</i> It is easy to repeat, but hard to
originate. Nature is readily made to repeat herself in
a thousand forms, and in the daguerreotype her own
light is amanuensis, and the picture too has more than
a surface significance,—a depth equal to the prospect,—so
that the microscope may be applied to the one as
the spy-glass to the other. Thus we may easily multiply
the forms of the outward; but to give the within outwardness,

Our sympathy is a gift whose value we can never

fame but love; for as our name may be on the lips of

When I read the other day the weight of some of the
generals of the Revolution, it seemed no unimportant
fact in their biography. It is at least one other means
of comparing ourselves with them. Tell me how much
Milton or Shakespeare weighed, and I will get weighed
myself, that I may know better what they are to me.
</p>

<p>
Weight has something very imposing in it, for we
cannot get rid of it. Once in the scales we must weigh.
And are we not always in the scales, and weighing just
our due, though we kick the beam, and do all we can
to heavy or lighten ourselves?

<p class="p2">
<i>Feb. 3. Wednesday.</i> The present seems never to get
its due; it is the least obvious,—neither before, nor
behind, but within us. All the past plays into this moment,
and we are what we are. My aspiration is one
thing, my reflection another, but, over all, myself and
condition is and does. To men and nature I am each

When we do a service to our neighbor, we serve our

It steads us to be as true to children and boors as to
God himself. It is the only attitude which will suit all
occasions; it only will make the earth yield her increase,
and by it do we effectually expostulate with the
wind. If I run against a post, this is the remedy. I would
meet the morning and evening on very sincere ground.
When the sun introduces me to a new day, I silently
say to myself, "Let us be faithful all round; we will
do justice and receive it." Something like this is the
secret charm of Nature's demeanor toward us, strict
conscientiousness [?] and disregard of us when we have
ceased to have regard for ourselves. So she can never
offend us. How true she is!—and never swerves.
In her most genial moment her laws are as steadfastly

Such a state of unrest becomes only a fluttered virtue.
When once I have learned my place in the sphere,
I will fill it once for all, rather like a fixed star than a
planet. I will rest as the mountains do, so that your
ladies might as well walk into the midst of the Tyrol,
and look for Nature to spread them a green lawn for
their disport in the midst of those solemn fastnesses,
as that I should fly out of my orbit at their approach
and go about eccentric, like a comet, to endanger other
systems. No, be true to your instincts, and sit; wait
till you can be genuinely polite, if it be till doomsday,
and not lose your chance everlastingly by a cowardly
yielding to young etiquette. By your look say unto them,
The lines have fallen to me in pleasant places, and I
will fill that station God has assigned me. As well Miss

to draw in his horns, that she might shine in his

How is it that motion will always find space to move
in, and rest a seat? Men hate antagonism, and the
weaker will always yield to the stronger. If a stranger
enter with sufficient determination into a crowded assembly,
as if commissioned by the gods to find a seat
there, as the falling stone by a divine impulse seeks a
resting-place, each one will rise without thinking to
offer his place. Now we have only to be commissioned
to sit, and depend upon it the gods will not balk their
own work. Ye came one day too late, as did the poet
after the world had been divided, and so returned to
dwell with the god that sent him. When presumptuous
womanhood demands to surrender my position, I bide
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_194" name="Page_194" href="#Page_194">194</a></span>
my time,—though it be with misgiving,—and yield to
no mortal shove, but expect a divine impulse. Produce
your warrant, and I will retire; for not now can I give
you a clear seat, but must leave part of my manhood
behind and wander a diminished man, who at length
will not have length and breadth enough to fill any seat
at all. It was very kind in the gods who gave us a now
condition, or condition of rest, in which we might unhurriedly
deliberate before taking a step. When I give
up my now and here without having secured my then
and there, I am the prodigal son of a kind father and
deserve no better than the husks which the swine eat,
nor that the fatted calf be killed for me.
</p>

<p>
Rest forever. When instinct comes to the rescue of
your politeness, it will seat you securely still, though it
be to hang by a rail or poise yourself on a stick. To do
otherwise is to be polite only as the soldier who runs
away when the enemy demands his post. Politeness is

Not only in his cunning hand and brain, but when
he speaks, too, does man assert his superiority. He
conquers the spaces with his voice, as well as the lion.
The voice of a strong man modulated to the cadence
of some tune is more imposing than any natural sound.
The keeper's is the most commanding, and is heard
over all the din of the menagerie. A strong, musical
voice imposes a new order and harmony upon nature;
from it as a centre the law is promulgated to the universe.
What it lacks in volume and loudness may
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_195" name="Page_195" href="#Page_195">195</a></span>
always be made up in musical expression and distinctness.
The brute growls to secure obedience; he threatens.
The man speaks as though obedience were already
secured.

<p class="p2">
Brave speaking is the most entire and richest sacrifice
to the gods.

<p class="p2">
<i>Feb. 5. Friday.</i> Only on rare occasions am I reminded
that man too has a voice, as well as birds and
quadrupeds, which breaks on the stillness of nature
with its peculiar accent. The least sound pervades and
subdues all space to it as long as it fills my ear. Contrasted
single with the silence, it is as wide as it. Music
is the crystallization of sound. There is something in
the effect of a harmonious voice upon the disposition
of its neighborhood analogous to the law of crystals;
it centralizes itself and sounds like the published law
of things. If the law of the universe were to be audibly
promulgated, no mortal lawgiver would suspect it, for
it would be a finer melody than his ears ever attended
to. It would be sphere music.<a name='FA_204' id='FA_204' href='#FN_204' class='fnanchor'>[204]</a>
</p>

<p class="p2">
When by tutoring their voices singers enhance one
another's performance, the harmony is more complete
and essential than is heard. The quire is one family
held together by a very close bond. Hence the romance
we associate with Gypsies and circus companies and
strolling musicians. The idea of brotherhood is so
strong in them. Their society is ideal for that one end.
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_196" name="Page_196" href="#Page_196">196</a></span>
</p>
<p>
There is something in this brotherhood—this feeling
of kind, or kindness—which insensibly elevates
the subjects of it in our eyes. However poor or mean,
they have something which counterbalances our contempt.
This is that in the strolling pauper <i>family</i> which
does not court our charity but can even bless and smile
on us and make the kindness reciprocal. It sanctifies
the place and the hour.
</p>

<p>
These Rainers, if they are not brothers and sisters,
must be uncles and cousins at least. These Swiss who
have come to sing to us, we have no doubt are the flower
of the Tyrol.<a name='FA_205' id='FA_205' href='#FN_205' class='fnanchor'>[205]</a> Such is the instinctive kindness with
which the foreigner is always received, that he is ever
presumed to be the fairest and noblest of his race. The
traveller finds that it is not easy to move away from
his friends, after all, but all people whom he visits are
anxious to supply the place to him of his parents and
brothers and sisters. To these Swiss I find that I have
attributed all Tell's patriotism and the devotion of
Arnold Winkelried and whatever goodness or greatness
belongs to the nation.
</p>

<p class="p2">
All costume off a man, when not simply doffed, is
grotesque. There must be a heart inside it. When these
Swiss appear before me in gaiters and high-crowned
hats with feathers, I am disposed to laugh, but soon I
see that their serious eye becomes these and they it. It
is the sincere life passed within it which consecrates
the costume of any people. A sufficiently sober eye will
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_197" name="Page_197" href="#Page_197">197</a></span>
retrieve itself and subordinate any grotesqueness. Let
Harlequin be taken with a fit of the colic in the midst of
his buffoonery, and his trappings and finery will serve
that mood too and with their drooping sympathy enhance
the sincerity of his misfortune. When the soldier
is hit by a cannon-ball, rags are as becoming as purple.<a name='FA_206' id='FA_206' href='#FN_206' class='fnanchor'>[206]</a>
So soon as a man engages to eat, drink, sleep, walk,
and sit, and meet all the contingencies of life therein,
his costume is hallowed and a theme for poetry, whether
it be a bear's skin or ermine, a beaver hat or a Turkish
turban. He will not wear anything because it is blue,
or black, or round, or square, but from a necessity
which cannot be superseded.
</p>

<p>
I look into the face and manners for something familiar
and homely even, to be assured that the costume of
the foreigner is not whimsical or finical.
</p>

In all emergencies there is always one step which you

<i>Feb. 6. Saturday.</i> One may discover a new side to
his most intimate friend when for the first time he hears
him speak in public. He will be stranger to him as he
is more familiar to the audience. The longest intimacy
could not foretell how he would behave then. When I
observe my friend's conduct toward others, then chiefly
I learn the traits in his character, and in each case I
am unprepared for the issue.
</p>

<p>
When one gets up to address briefly a strange audience,
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_198" name="Page_198" href="#Page_198">198</a></span>
in that little he may have opportunity to say he
will not quite do himself injustice. For he will instantly
and instinctively average himself to his audience, and
while he is true to his own character still, he will in a
few moments make that impression which a series of
months and years would but expand. Before he answers,
his thought like lightning runs round the whole
compass of his experiences, and he is scrupulous to
speak from that which he is and with a more entire
truthfulness than usual. How little do we know each
other then! Who can tell how his friend would behave
on any occasion?
</p>

<p class="p2">
As for those Swiss, I think of the fields their hands
have plowed and reaped, and respect their costume
as the memorial or rather cotemporary and witness of
this. What is there in a toga but a Roman? What but
a Quaker in a broad-brimmed hat? He who describes
the dress of a Janizary going to war does me a similar
service as when he paints the scenery of the battle-field.
It helps make his exploit picturesque.
</p>

<p>
Costume is not determined by whim, not even the
tattooing and paint of the savage. Sun, wind, rain, and
the form of our bodies shape our hats and coats for us,
more even than taste. Good taste secures the utmost
gratification without sacrificing any conveniences. If
all nations derived their fashions from Paris or London,
the world would seem like a Vanity Fair or all fools'
day, and the Tartar and Bedouin ride in it like jesters
in a circus, and the Pawnee and Esquimau hunt in
masquerade. What I am must make you forget what I
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_199" name="Page_199" href="#Page_199">199</a></span>
wear. The fashionable world is content to be eclipsed
by its dress, and never will bear the contrast. Only
industry will reform <i>their</i> dress. They are idle,—<i>exo</i>strious,
building without.
</p>

<p class="p2">
The value of the recess in any public entertainment
consists in the opportunity for self-recovery which it
offers. We who have been swayed as one heart, expanding
and contracting with the common pulse, find ourselves
in the interim, and set us up again, and feel our
own hearts beating in our breasts. We are always a
little astonished to see a man walking across the room,
through an attentive audience, with any degree of self-possession.
He makes himself strange to us. He is a
little stubborn withal, and seems to say, "I am self-sustained
and independent as well as the performer, and
am not to be swallowed up in the common enthusiasm.
No, no, there are two of us, and John's as good as
Thomas." In the recess the audience is cut up into a
hundred little coteries, and as soon as each individual
life has recovered its tone and the purposes of health
have been answered, it is time for the performances to
commence again.
</p>

<p class="p2">
In a public performer, the simplest actions, which at
other times are left to unconscious nature, as the ascending
a few steps in front of an audience, acquire a fatal
importance and become arduous deeds.
</p>

<p class="p2">
When I select one here and another there, and strive
to join sundered thoughts, I make but a partial heap
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_200" name="Page_200" href="#Page_200">200</a></span>
after all. Nature strews her nuts and flowers broadcast,
and never collects them into heaps. A man does not
tell us all he has thought upon truth or beauty at a sitting,
but, from his last thought on the subject, wanders
through a varied scenery of upland, meadow, and woodland
to his next. Sometimes a single and casual thought
rises naturally and inevitably with a queenly majesty
and escort, like the stars in the east. Fate has surely
enshrined it in this hour and circumstances for some
purpose. What she has joined together, let not man
put asunder. Shall I transplant the primrose by the
river's brim, to set it beside its sister on the mountain?
<i>This</i> was the soil it grew in, <i>this</i> the hour it bloomed
in. If sun, wind, and rain came <i>here</i> to cherish and
expand it, shall not we come here to pluck it? Shall
we require it to grow in a conservatory for our convenience?
</p>

<p class="p2">
I feel slightly complimented when Nature condescends
to make use of me without my knowledge, as
when I help scatter her seeds in my walk, or carry burs
and cockles on my clothes from field to field.<a name='FA_207' id='FA_207' href='#FN_207' class='fnanchor'>[207]</a> I feel as
though I had done something for the commonweal,
and were entitled to board and lodging. I take such
airs upon me as the boy who holds a horse for the circus
company, whom all the spectators envy.

All things prophesy but the prophet. In augury and
divination nature is put to the torture. In Ben Jonson's
tragedy of "Catiline," Lentulus makes answer to Catiline,
who has bribed the augurs to say that he is that
third Cornelius who is to be king of Rome, "All prophecies,
you know, suffer the torture." He who inspects
the entrails is <i>always</i> bribed, but they are unbribable.
He who seeks to know the future by unlawful means
has unavoidably subjected the oracle to the torture of
<i>private</i> and <i>partial</i> interests. The oracles of God serve
the public interest without fee. To the just and benevolent
mind nature <i>declares</i>, as the sun lights the world.

<i>Feb. 7. Sunday.</i> Without greatcoat or drawers I have
advanced thus far into the snow-banks of the winter,
without thought and with impunity.<a name='FA_208' id='FA_208' href='#FN_208' class='fnanchor'>[208]</a> When I meet my
neighbors in muffs and furs and tippets, they look as if
they had retreated into the interior fastnesses from some
foe invisible to me. They remind me that this is the season
of winter, in which it becomes a man to be cold. For
feeling, I am a piece of clean wood of this shape, which
will do service till it rots, and though the cold has its
physical effect on me, it is a kindly one, for it "finds its
acquaintance there." My diet is so little stimulating,
and my body in consequence so little heated, as to excite
no antagonism in nature, but flourishes like a tree,
which finds even the winter genial to its expansion and
the secretion of sap. May not the body defend itself
against cold by its very nakedness, and its elements be
so simple and single that they cannot congeal? Frost
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_202" name="Page_202" href="#Page_202">202</a></span>
does not affect one but several. My body now affords
no more pasture for cold than a leafless twig.<a name='FA_209' id='FA_209' href='#FN_209' class='fnanchor'>[209]</a> I call it
a protestant warmth. My limbs do not tire as formerly,
but I use myself as any other piece of nature, and from
mere indifference and thoughtlessness may break the
timber.
</p>

<p>
It is the vice of the last season which compels us to
arm ourselves for the next. If man always conformed
to Nature, he would not have to defend himself against
her, but find her his constant nurse and friend, as do
plants and quadrupeds.
</p>

<p class="p2">
In the sunshine and the crowing of cocks I feel an
illimitable holiness, which makes me bless God and
myself. The warm sun casts his incessant gift at my
feet as I walk along, unfolding his yellow worlds. Yonder
sexton with a few cheap sounds makes me richer
than these who mind his summons. The true gift is
as wide as my gratitude, and as frequent, and the
donor is as grateful as the recipient. There would
be a New Year's gift indeed, if we would bestow on
each other our sincerity. We should communicate our
wealth, and not purchase that which does not belong
to us for a sign. Why give each other a sign to keep?
If we gave the thing itself, there would be no need of
a sign.

<p class="p2">
I am not sure I should find out a really great person
soon. He would be simple Thomas or Oliver for
some centuries first. The lesser eminences would hide
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_203" name="Page_203" href="#Page_203">203</a></span>
the higher, and I should at last reach his top by a gentle
acclivity. I felt it would be necessary to remain some
weeks at the Notch to be impressed by the grandeur
of the scenery. We do not expect that Alexander will
conquer Asia the first time we are introduced to him.
A great man accepts the occasion the fates offer him.
Let us not be disappointed. We stand at first upon the
pampas which surround him. It is these mountains
round about which make the valleys here below. He
is not a dead level, so many feet above low-water mark.
Greatness is in the ascent. But there is no accounting
for the little men.

They are my correspondent, to whom daily I send off
this sheet postpaid. I am clerk in their counting-room,

path. I bend the twig and write my prayers on it; then
letting it go, the bough springs up and shows the scrawl
to heaven. As if it were not kept shut in my desk, but
were as public a leaf as any in nature. It is papyrus
by the riverside; it is vellum in the pastures; it is parchment
on the hills. I find it everywhere as free as the
leaves which troop along the lanes in autumn. The
crow, the goose, the eagle carry my quill, and the wind

In our holiest moment our devil with a leer stands
close at hand. He is a very busy devil. It gains vice
some respect, I must confess, thus to be reminded how
indefatigable it is. It has at least the merit of industriousness.
When I go forth with zeal to some good work,
my devil is sure to get his robe tucked up the first and
arrives there as soon as I, with a look of sincere earnestness
which puts to shame my best intent. He is as
forward as I to a good work, and as disinterested. He
has a winning way of recommending himself by making
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_208" name="Page_208" href="#Page_208">208</a></span>
himself useful. How readily he comes into my best
project, and does his work with a quiet and steady
cheerfulness which even virtue may take pattern from.
</p>

<p>
I never was so rapid in my virtue but my vice kept
up with me. It always came in by a hand, and never
panting, but with a curried coolness halted, as if halting
were the beginning not the end of the course. It
only runs the swifter because it has no rider. It never
was behind me but when I turned to look and so fell
behind myself. I never did a charitable thing but there
he stood, scarce in the rear, with hat in hand, partner
on the same errand, ready to share the smile of gratitude.
Though I shut the door never so quick and tell
it to stay at home like a good dog, it will out with me,
for I shut in my own legs so, and it escapes in the meanwhile
and is ready to back and reinforce me in most
virtuous deeds. And if I turn and say, "Get thee behind
me," he then indeed turns too and takes the lead,
though he seems to retire with a pensive and compassionate
look, as much as to say, "Ye know not what ye do."

<p>
Just as active as I become to virtue, just so active is
my remaining vice. Every time we teach our virtue
a new nobleness, we teach our vice a new cunning.
When we sharpen the blade it will stab better as well as
whittle. The scythe that cuts will cut our legs. We are
double-edged blades, and every time we whet our virtue
the return stroke straps our vice. And when we cut
a clear descending blow, our vice on t'other edge rips
up the work. Where is the skillful swordsman that can
draw his blade straight back out of the wound?<a name='FA_213' id='FA_213' href='#FN_213' class='fnanchor'>[213]</a>

<p class="p2">
My life at this moment is like a summer morning
when birds are singing. Yet that is false, for nature's
is an idle pleasure in comparison: my hour has a more
solid serenity. I have been breaking silence these twenty-three
years and have hardly made a rent in it. Silence
has no end; speech is but the beginning of it. My friend
thinks I <i>keep</i> silence, who am only choked with letting
it out so fast. Does he forget that new mines of secrecy
are constantly opening in me?
</p>

<p class="p2">
If any scorn your love, let them see plainly that you
serve not them but another. If these bars are up, go
your way to other of God's pastures, and browse there the
while. When your host shuts his door on you he incloses
you in the dwelling of nature. He thrusts you over the
threshold of the world. My foes restore me to my friends.
</p>

<p class="p2">
I might say friendship had no ears as love has no
eyes, for no word is evidence in its court. The least act
fulfills more than all words profess. The most gracious
speech is but partial kindness, but the least genuine
deed takes the whole man. If we had waited till doomsday
it could never have been uttered.

<i>Feb. 10. Wednesday.</i> That was fine praise which
Ben Jonson gave to Thomas, Lord Chancellor:—
</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<p class="o1">"Whilst thou art certain to thy words, once gone,</p>
<p>As is thy conscience, which is always one."</p>
</div></div></div>

<p>
Words do not lose their truth by time or misinterpretation,
but stand unscathed longer than he who
spoke them.
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_211" name="Page_211" href="#Page_211">211</a></span>
</p>
<p>
Let our words be such as we may unblushingly behold
sculptured in granite on the walls to the least syllable.
Our thoughts and actions may be very private
for a long time, for they demand a more catholic publicity
to be displayed in than the world can afford. Our
best deeds shun the narrow walks of men, and are not
ambitious of the faint light the world can shed on them,
but delight to unfold themselves in that public ground
between God and conscience.
</p>

<p>
Truth has for audience and spectator all the world.
Within, where I resolve and deal with principles, there
is more space and room than anywhere without, where
my hands execute. Men should hear of your virtue only
as they hear the creaking of the earth's axle and the
music of the spheres. It will fall into the course of
nature and be effectually concealed by publicness.
</p>

<p class="p2">
I asked a man to-day if he would rent me some land,
and he said he had four acres as good soil "as any outdoors."
It was a true poet's account of it. He and I,
and all the world, went outdoors to breathe the free
air and stretch ourselves. For the world is but outdoors,—and
we duck behind a panel.
</p>

<p class="p2">
<i>Feb. 11.</i> True help, for the most part, implies a greatness
in him who is to be helped as well as in the helper.
It takes a god to be helped even. A great person, though
unconsciously, will constantly give you great opportunities
to serve him, but a mean one will quite preclude
all active benevolence. It needs but simply and <i>greatly</i>
to want it for once, that all true men may contend who
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_212" name="Page_212" href="#Page_212">212</a></span>
shall be foremost to render aid. My neighbor's state
must pray to heaven so devoutly yet disinterestedly as
he never prayed in words, before my ears can hear. It
must ask divinely. But men so cobble and botch their
request, that you must stoop as low as they to give them
aid. Their meanness would drag down your deed to be
a compromise with conscience, and not leave it to be
done on the high table-land of the benevolent soul.
They would have you doff your bright and knightly
armor and drudge for them,—serve <i>them</i> and not
God. But if I am to serve them I must not serve the
devil.
</p>

<p>
What is called charity is no charity, but the interference
of a third person. Shall I interfere with fate?
Shall I defraud man of the opportunities which God
gave him, and so take away his life? Beggars and silent
poor cry—how often!—"Get between me and
my god." I will not stay to cobble and patch God's
rents, but do clean, new work when he has given me
my hands full. This almshouse charity is like putting
new wine into old bottles, when so many tuns in God's
cellars stand empty. We go about mending the times,
when we should be building the eternity.
</p>

<p>
I must serve a strong master, not a weak one. Help
implies a sympathy of energy and effort, else no alleviation
will avail.
</p>

<p class="p2">
<i>Feb. 12. Friday.</i> Those great men who are unknown
to their own generation are already famous in the society
of the great who have gone before them. All worldly
fame but subsides from their high estimate beyond the
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_213" name="Page_213" href="#Page_213">213</a></span>
stars. We may still keep pace with those who have gone
out of nature, for we run on as smooth ground as they.

<i>Feb. 13.</i> By the truthfulness of our story to-day we
help explain ourselves for all our life henceforth. How
we hamper and belay ourselves by the least exaggeration!
The truth is God's concern; He will sustain it;
but who can afford to maintain a lie? We have taken
away one of the Pillars of Hercules, and must support
the world on our shoulders, who might have walked
freely upon it.

My neighbor says that his hill-farm is poor stuff and
"only fit to hold the world together."<a name='FA_214' id='FA_214' href='#FN_214' class='fnanchor'>[214]</a> He deserves that
God should give him better for so brave a treating of
his gifts, instead of humbly putting up therewith. It is
a sort of stay, or gore, or gusset, and he will not be
blinded by modesty or gratitude, but sees it for what
it is; knowing his neighbor's fertile land, he calls his
by its right name. But perhaps my farmer forgets that
his lean soil has sharpened his wits. This is a crop it
was good for. And beside, you see the heavens at a
lesser angle from the hill than from the vale.

<i>Feb. 14. Sunday.</i> I am confined to the house by bronchitis,
and so seek to content myself with that quiet
and serene life there is in a warm corner by the fireside,
and see the sky through the chimney-top. Sickness
should not be allowed to extend further than the body.
We need only to retreat further within us to preserve
uninterrupted the continuity of serene hours to the end
of our lives.

<i>Feb. 15.</i> There is elevation in every hour. No part
of the earth is so low and withdrawn that the heavens
cannot be seen from it, but every part supports the sky.
We have only to stand on the eminence of the hour, and
look out thence into the empyrean, allowing no pinnacle
above us, to command an uninterrupted horizon. The
moments will lie outspread around us like a blue expanse
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_215" name="Page_215" href="#Page_215">215</a></span>
of mountain and valley, while we stand on the
summit of our hour as if we had descended on eagle's
wings. For the eagle has stooped to his perch on the
highest cliff and has never climbed the rock; he stands
by his wings more than by his feet. We shall not want
a foothold, but wings will sprout from our shoulders,
and we shall walk securely, self-sustained.

The mechanic works no longer than his labor will
pay for lights, fuel, and shop rent. Would it not be well

Our actions do not use time independently, as the

<i>Feb. 18. Thursday.</i> I do not judge men by anything
they can do. Their greatest deed is the impression they
make on me. Some serene, inactive men can do everything.
Talent only indicates a depth of character in
some direction. We do not acquire the ability to do
new deeds, but a new capacity for all deeds. My recent
growth does not appear in any visible new talent, but
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_216" name="Page_216" href="#Page_216">216</a></span>
its deed will enter into my gaze when I look into the
sky, or vacancy. It will help me to consider ferns and
everlasting. Man is like a tree which is limited to no
age, but grows as long as it has its root in the ground.
We have only to live in the alburnum and not in the
old wood. The gnarled stump has as tender a bud as
the sapling.

<i>Feb. 19.</i> A truly good book attracts very little favor
to itself. It is so true that it teaches me better than to
read it. I must soon lay it down and commence living
on its hint. I do not see how any can be written more,
but this is the last effusion of genius. When I read an
indifferent book, it seems the best thing I can do, but
the inspiring volume hardly leaves me leisure to finish
its latter pages. It is slipping out of my fingers while I
read. It creates no atmosphere in which it may be perused,
but one in which its teachings may be practiced.
It confers on me such wealth that I lay it down with the
least regret. What I began by reading I must finish
by acting. So I cannot stay to hear a <i>good</i> sermon and
applaud at the conclusion, but shall be half-way to
Thermopylæ before that.

When any joke or hoax traverses the Union in the
newspapers it apprises me of a fact which no geography
or guide-book contains, of a certain leisure and nonchalance
pervading society. It is a piece of information
from over the Alleghanies, which I know how to prize,
though I did not expect it. And it is just so in Nature.
I sometimes observe in her a strange trifling, almost
listlessness, which conducts to beauty and grace,—the
fantastic and whimsical forms of snow and ice, the unaccountable
freaks which the tracks of rabbits exhibit.
I know now why all those busy speculators do not die of
fever and ague.

When I am going out for an evening I arrange the

be at home, I sometimes make believe that I may go

leave our life in a condition to go alone, and not to
require a constant supervision. We will then sit down

I hear the faint sound of a viol and voices from the
neighboring cottage, and think to myself, "I will believe
the Muse only for evermore." It assures me that
no gleam which comes over the serene soul is deceptive.
It warns me of a reality and substance, of which the
best that I see is but the phantom and shadow. O music,
thou tellest me of things of which memory takes no
heed; thy strains are whispered aside from memory's
ear.

This is the noblest plain of earth, over which these

Thou openest all my senses to catch thy least hint,

are. My imperfect sympathies with my friend are cheerful,

<i>Feb. 21. Sunday.</i> It is hard to preserve equanimity
and greatness on that debatable ground between love
and esteem. There is nothing so stable and unfluctuating
as love. The waves beat steadfast on its shore
forever, and its tide has no ebb. It is a resource in all
extremities, and a refuge even from itself. And yet
love will not be leaned on.

The whole of the day should not be daytime, nor of

hour at least which the day did not bring forth,—of
ancient parentage and long-established nobility,—which
will be a serene and lofty platform overlooking
the rest. We should make our notch every day on our
characters, as Robinson Crusoe on his stick. We must

tiller-rope in our hands, and know that if we sail, we

Friends will be much apart; they will respect more

and has much private business. The hours he devotes

Like a Persian city or hanging gardens in the distance,
so washed in light, so untried, only to be thridded by

The heavens hang over it like some low screen, and

bestir themselves within me and move grandly towards
a consummation, as ships go down the Thames. A
steady onward motion I feel in me, as still as that, or

These various words are not without various meanings.
The combined voice of the race makes nicer distinctions
than any individual. There are the words
"diversion" and "amusement." It takes more to amuse
than to divert. We must be surrendered to our amusements,
but only turned aside to our diversions. We
have no will in the former, but oversee the latter.
We are oftenest diverted in the street, but amused in
our chambers. We are diverted from our engagements,
but amused when we are listless. We may be diverted
from an amusement, and amused by a diversion. It
often happens that a diversion becomes our amusement,

<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_226" name="Page_226" href="#Page_226">226</a></span>
best you are. Every sentence is the result of a long probation.
The author's character is read from title-page
to end. Of this he never corrects the proofs. We read
it as the essential character of a handwriting without
regard to the flourishes. And so of the rest of our actions;
it runs as straight as a ruled line through them
all, no matter how many curvets about it. Our whole
life is taxed for the least thing well done; it is its net
result. How we eat, drink, sleep, and use our desultory
hours, now in these indifferent days, with no eye to observe
and no occasion [to] excite us, determines our
authority and capacity for the time to come.

<i>March 3.</i> I hear a man blowing a horn this still
evening, and it sounds like the plaint of nature in these
times. In this, which I refer to some man, there is something
greater than any man. It is as if the earth spoke.
It adds a great remoteness to the horizon, and its very
distance is grand, as when one draws back the head to
speak. That which I now hear in the west seems like
an invitation to the east. It runs round the earth as a
whisper gallery. It is the spirit of the West calling to the
spirit of the East, or else it is the rattling of some team
lagging in Day's train. Coming to me through the darkness
and silence, all things great seem transpiring there.
It is friendly as a distant hermit's taper. When it is
trilled, or undulates, the heavens are crumpled into time,
and successive waves flow across them.
</p>

<p>
It is a strangely healthy sound for these disjointed
times. It is a rare soundness when cow-bells and horns
are heard from over the fields. And now I see the beauty
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_227" name="Page_227" href="#Page_227">227</a></span>
and full meaning of that word "sound." Nature always
possesses a certain sonorousness, as in the hum
of insects, the booming of ice, the crowing of cocks in
the morning, and the barking of dogs in the night, which
indicates her sound state.<a name='FA_224' id='FA_224' href='#FN_224' class='fnanchor'>[224]</a> God's voice is but a clear
bell sound. I drink in a wonderful health, a cordial,
in sound. The effect of the slightest tinkling in the
horizon measures my own soundness. I thank God for
sound; it always mounts, and makes me mount. I think
I will not trouble myself for any wealth, when I can be so
cheaply enriched. Here I contemplate to drudge that
I may own a farm—and may have such a limitless
estate for the listening. All good things are cheap: all
bad are very dear.

<p class="p2">
As for these communities, I think I had rather keep
bachelor's hall in hell than go to board in heaven. Do
you think your virtue will be boarded with you? It will
never live on the interest of your money, depend upon it.
The boarder has no home. In heaven I hope to bake
my own bread and clean my own linen. The tomb is
the only boarding-house in which a hundred are served
at once. In the catacomb we may dwell together and
prop one another without loss.

<i>March 4.</i> Ben Jonson says in his epigrams,—
</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<p>"He makes himself a thorough-fare of Vice."</p>
</div></div></div>

<p>
This is true, for by vice the substance of a man is not
changed, but all his pores, and cavities, and avenues are
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_228" name="Page_228" href="#Page_228">228</a></span>
prophaned by being made the thoroughfares of vice. He
is the highway of his vice. The searching devil courses
through and through him. His flesh and blood and bones
are cheapened. He is all trivial, a place where three
highways of sin meet. So is another the thoroughfare
of virtue, and virtue circulates through all his aisles like
a wind, and he is hallowed.
</p>

<p class="p2">
We reprove each other unconsciously by our own
behavior. Our very carriage and demeanor in the streets
should be a reprimand that will go to the conscience of
every beholder. An infusion of love from a great soul
gives a color to our faults, which will discover them, as
lunar caustic detects impurities in water.
</p>

<p class="p2">
The best will not seem to go contrary to others, but,
as if <i>they</i> could afford to travel the same way, they go
a parallel but higher course, a sort of upper road. Jonson
says,—

"THE SPHINX"<a name='FA_225' id='FA_225' href='#FN_225' class='fnanchor'>[225]</a>
</p>

<p>
<i>March 7, 8, 9, 10.</i> The Sphinx is man's insatiable and
questioning spirit, which still, as of old, stands by the
roadside in us and proposes the riddle of life to every
passer. The ancients represented this by a monster
who was a riddle of herself, having a body composed
of various creatures, as if to hint that she had no individual
existence, but was nearly allied to and brooded
over all. They made her devour those who were unable
to explain her enigmas, as we are devoured by doubt,
and struggle towards the light, as if to be assured of
our lives. For we live by confidence, and our bravery
is in some moment when we are certain to that degree
that our certainty cannot be increased; as, when a ray
bursts through a gap in a cloud, it darts as far, and
reaches the earth as surely, as the whole sun would have
done.
</p>

<p>
1. In the first four lines is described the mood in
which the Sphinx bestirs herself in us. We must look
on the world with a drowsy and half-shut eye, that it
may not be too much in our eye, and rather stand aloof
from than within it. When we are awake to the real
world, we are asleep to the actual. The sinful drowse
to eternity, the virtuous to time. Menu says that the
"supreme omnipresent intelligence" is "a spirit which
can only be conceived by a mind <i>slumbering</i>." Wisdom
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_230" name="Page_230" href="#Page_230">230</a></span>
and holiness always slumber; they are never active in
the ways of the world. As in our night-dreams we are
nearest to awakening, so in our day-dreams we are
nearest to a supernatural awakening, and the plain
and flat satisfactoriness of life becomes so significant
as to be questioned.
</p>

<p>
The Sphinx hints that in the ages her secret is kept,
but in the annihilation of ages alone is it revealed. So
far from solving the problem of life, Time only serves
to propose and keep it in. Time waits but for its solution
to become eternity. Its lapse is measured by the
successive failures to answer the incessant question,
and the generations of men are the unskillful passengers
devoured.
</p>

<p>
2. She hints generally at man's mystery. He knows
only that he is, not what, nor whence. Not only is he
curiously and wonderfully wrought, but with Dædalian
intricacy. He is lost in himself as a labyrinth and has
no clue to get out by. If he could get out of his humanity,
he would have got out of nature. "Dædalian"
expresses both the skill and the inscrutable design of
the builder.
</p>

<p>
The insolubleness of the riddle is only more forcibly
expressed by the lines,—
</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<p>"Out of sleeping a waking,</p>
<p class="i1">  Out of waking a sleep."</p>
</div></div></div>

<p>
They express the complete uncertainty and renunciation
of knowledge of the propounder.
</p>

<p>
3, 4, 5, 6. In these verses is described the integrity
of all animate and inanimate things but man,—how
each is a problem of itself and not the solution of one
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_231" name="Page_231" href="#Page_231">231</a></span>
and presides over and uses the mystery of the universe
as unhesitatingly as if it were the partner of God; how,
by a sort of <i>essential and practical faith</i>, each understands
all, for to see that we understand is to know that
we misunderstand. Each natural object is an end to
itself. A brave, undoubting life do they all live, and are
content to be a part of the mystery which is God, and
throw the responsibility on man of explaining them and
himself too.
</p>

<p>
3. The outlines of the trees are as correct as if ruled
by God on the sky. The motions of quadrupeds and
birds Nature never thinks to mend, but they are a last
copy and the flourishes of His hand.
</p>

<p>
4. The waves lapse with such a melody on the shore
as shows that they have long been at one with Nature.
Theirs is as perfect play as if the heavens and earth
were not. They meet with a sweet difference and independently,
as old playfellows. Nothing do they
lack more than the world. The ripple is proud to be
a ripple and balances the sea. The atoms, which are
in such a continual flux, notwithstanding their minuteness,
have a certain essential valor and independence.
They have the integrity of worlds, and attract and
repel firmly as such. The least has more manhood
than Democritus.
</p>

<p>
5. So also in Nature the perfection of the whole is
the perfection of the parts, and what is itself perfect
serves to adorn and set off all the rest. Her distinctions
are but reliefs. Night veileth the morning for the morning's
sake, and the vapor adds a new attraction to the
hill. Nature looks like a conspiracy for the advantage
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_232" name="Page_232" href="#Page_232">232</a></span>
of all her parts; when one feature shines, all the rest
seem suborned to heighten its charm. In her circle each
gladly gives precedence to the other. Day gladly alternates
with night. Behind these the vapor atones to the
hill for its interference, and this harmonious scene is
the effect of that at-one-ment.
</p>

<p>
6. In a sense the babe takes its departure from
Nature as the grown man his departure out of her, and
so during its nonage is at one with her, and as a part
of herself. It is indeed the very flower and blossom of
Nature.
</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<p class="o1">"Shines the peace of all being</p>
<p class="i1">Without cloud, in its eyes;</p>
<p>And the <i>sum</i> of the world</p>
<p class="i1">In soft <i>miniature</i> lies."<a name='FA_226' id='FA_226' href='#FN_226' class='fnanchor'>[226]</a></p>
</div></div></div>

<p>
To the charming consistency of the palm and thrush,
this universal and serene beauty is added, as all the
leaves of the tree flower in the blossom.
</p>

<p>
7. But alas, the fruit to be matured in these petals
is fated to break the stem which holds it to universal
consistency. It passes <i>through Nature</i> to manhood, and
becomes unnatural, without being as yet quite supernatural.
Man's most approved life is but conformity,
not a simple and independent consistency, which would
make all things conform to it. His actions do not adorn
Nature nor one another, nor does she exist in harmony
but in contrast with them. She is not their willing
scenery. We conceive that if a true action were to be
performed it would be assisted by Nature, and perhaps
be fondled and reflected many times as the rainbow.
The sun is a true light for the trees in a picture, but not
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_233" name="Page_233" href="#Page_233">233</a></span>
for the actions of men. They will not bear so strong a
light as the stubble; the universe has little sympathy
with them, and sooner or later they rebound hollowly
on the memory. The April shower should be as reviving
to our life as to the garden and the grove, and the scenery
in which we live reflect our own beauty, as the dewdrop
the flower. It is the actual man, not the actual
Nature, that hurts the romance of the landscape. "He
poisons the ground." The haymakers must be lost in
the grass of the meadow. They may be Faustus and
Amyntas here, but near at hand they are Reuben and
Jonas. The woodcutter must not be better than the
wood, lest he be <i>worse</i>. Neither will bear to be considered
as a distinct feature. Man's works must lie in the
bosom of Nature, cottages be buried in trees, or under
vines and moss, like rocks, that they may not outrage
the landscape. The hunter must be dressed in Lincoln
green, with a plume of eagle's feathers, to imbosom
him in Nature. So the skillful painter secures the distinctness
of the whole by the indistinctness of the parts.
We can endure best to consider our repose and silence.
Only when the city, the hamlet, or the cottage is viewed
from a distance does man's life seem in harmony with
the universe; but seen closely his actions have no eagle's
feathers or Lincoln green to redeem them. The sunlight
on cities at a distance is a deceptive beauty, but foretells
the final harmony of man with Nature.
</p>

<p>
Man as he is, is not the subject of any art, strictly
speaking. The naturalist pursues his study with love,
but the moralist persecutes his with hate. In man is
the material of a picture, with a design partly sketched,
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_234" name="Page_234" href="#Page_234">234</a></span>
but Nature is such a picture drawn and colored. He
is a studio, Nature a gallery. If men were not idealists,
no sonnets to beautiful persons nor eulogies on worthy
ones would ever be written. We wait for the preacher
to express <i>such</i> love for his congregation as the botanist
for his herbarium.
</p>

<p>
8. Man, however, detects something in the lingering
ineradicable sympathy of Nature which seems to
side with him against the stern decrees of the soul.
Her essential friendliness is only the more apparent to
his waywardness, for disease and sorrow are but a
rupture with her. In proportion as he renounces his
will, she repairs his hurts, and, if she burns, does oftener
warm, if she freezes, oftener refreshes. This is the motherliness
which the poet personifies, and the Sphinx,
or wisely inquiring man, makes express a real concern
for him. Nature shows us a stern kindness, and only we
are unkind. She endures long with us, and though
the severity of her law is unrelaxed, yet its evenness and
impartiality look relenting, and almost sympathize with
our fault.
</p>

<p>
9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14. But to the poet there are no riddles.
They are "pleasant songs" to him; his faith solves
the enigmas which recurring wisdom does not fail to
repeat. Poetry is the only solution time can offer. But
the poet is soonest a pilgrim from his own faith. Our
brave moments may still be distinguished from our wise.
Though the problem is always solved for the soul, still
does it remain to be solved by the intellect. Almost
faith puts the question, for only in her light can it be
answered. However true the answer, it does not prevent
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_235" name="Page_235" href="#Page_235">235</a></span>
the question; for the best answer is but plausible,
and man can only tell his relation to truth, but render
no account of truth to herself.
</p>

<p>
9. Believe, and ask not, says the poet.
</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<p class="o1">"Deep love lieth under</p>
<p class="i1">These pictures of time;</p>
<p>They fade in the light of</p>
<p class="i1">Their meaning sublime."</p>
</div></div></div>

<p>
Nothing is plain but love.
</p>

<p>
10, 11, 12, 13. Man comes short, because he seeks
perfection. He adorns no world, while he is seeking to
adorn a better. His best actions have no reference to
their actual scenery. For when our actions become of
that worth that they might confer a grace on Nature,
they pass out of her into a higher arena, where they are
still mean and awkward. So that the world beholds
only the rear of great deeds, and mistakes them often
for inconsistencies, not knowing with what higher they
consist. Nature is beautiful as in repose, not promising
a higher beauty to-morrow. Her actions are level
to one another, and so are never unfit or inconsistent.
Shame and remorse, which are so unsightly to her, have
a prospective beauty and fitness which redeem them.
We would have our lover to be nobler than we, and do
not fear to sacrifice our love to his greater nobleness.
Better the disagreement of noble lovers than the agreement
of base ones. In friendship each will be nobler
than the other, and so avoid the cheapness of a level
and idle harmony. Love will have its chromatic strains,—discordant
yearnings for higher chords,—as well
as symphonies. Let us expect no finite satisfaction.
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_236" name="Page_236" href="#Page_236">236</a></span>
</p>
<p>
13. Who looks in the sun will see no light else; but
also he will see no shadow. Our life revolves unceasingly,
but the centre is ever the same, and the wise will
regard only the seasons of the soul.
</p>

<p>
14. The poet concludes with the same trust he began
with, and jeers at the blindness which could inquire.
But our sphinx is so wise as to put no riddle that can
be answered. It is a great presumption to answer
conclusively a question which any sincerity has put.
The wise answer no questions,—nor do they ask
them. She silences his jeers with the conviction that
she is the eye-beam of his eye. Our proper eye never
quails before an answer. To rest in a reply, as a
response of the oracle, that is error; but to suspect
time's reply, because we would not degrade one of
God's meanings to be intelligible to us, that is wisdom.
We shall never arrive at his meaning, but it will ceaselessly
arrive to us. The truth we seek with ardor and
devotion will not reward us with a cheap acquisition.
We run unhesitatingly in our career, not fearing to
pass any goal of truth in our haste. We career toward
her eternally. A truth rested in stands for all the
vice of an age, and revolution comes kindly to restore
health.
</p>

<p>
16. The cunning Sphinx, who had been hushed
into stony silence and repose in us, arouses herself and
detects a mystery in all things,—in infancy, the moon,
fire, flowers, sea, mountain,—and,
</p>

<p>
(17) in the spirit of the old fable, declares proudly,—
</p>

<div class="poetry-container">

When some Œdipus has solved one of her enigmas,
she will go dash her head against a rock.

riddle. Indeed, I doubt if she could solve it herself.

<i>March 11. Thursday.</i> Every man understands why
a fool sings.
</p>

<p class="p2">
<i>March 13. Saturday.</i> There is a sort of homely truth
and naturalness in some books, which is very rare to
find, and yet looks quite cheap. There may be nothing
lofty in the sentiment, or polished in the expression, but
it is careless, countrified talk. The scholar rarely writes
as well as the farmer talks. Homeliness is a great merit
in a book; it is next to beauty and a high art. Some
have this merit only. A few homely expressions redeem
them. Rusticity is pastoral, but affectation merely civil.
The scholar does not make his most familiar experience
come gracefully to the aid of his expression, and hence,
though he live in it, his books contain no tolerable pictures
of the country and simple life. Very few men can
speak of Nature with any truth. They confer no favor;
they do not speak a good word for her. Most cry better
than they speak. You can get more nature out of them
by pinching than by addressing them. It is naturalness,
and not simply good nature, that interests. I like better
the surliness with which the woodchopper speaks of his
woods, handling them as indifferently as his axe, than the
mealy-mouthed enthusiasm of the lover of nature. Better
that the primrose by the river's brim be a yellow primrose
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_238" name="Page_238" href="#Page_238">238</a></span>
and nothing more, than the victim of his bouquet
or herbarium, to shine with the flickering dull light of
his imagination, and not the golden gleam of a star.
</p>

<p>
Aubrey relates of Thomas Fuller that his was "a
very working head, in so much, that walking and meditating
before dinner, he would eat up a penny loaf, not
knowing that he did it. His natural memory was very
great, to which he added the art of memory. He would
repeat to you forwards and backwards all the signs
from Ludgate to Charing-cross." These are very good
and wholesome facts to know of a man, as copious as
some modern volumes.
</p>

<p>
He also says of Mr. John Hales, that, "he loved
Canarie" and was buried "under an altar monument
of black marble ... with a too long epitaph;" of
Edmund Halley, that he "at sixteen could make a dial,
and then he said he thought himself a brave fellow;"
of William Holder, who wrote a book upon his curing
one Popham, who was deaf and dumb, "He was beholding
to no author; did only consult with nature."
For the most part an author but consults with all who
have written before upon any subject, and his book is
but the advice of so many. But a true book will never
have been forestalled, but the topic itself will be new,
and, by consulting with nature, it will consult not only
with those who have gone before, but with those who
may come after. There is always room and occasion
enough for a true book on any subject, as there is room
for more light the brightest day, and more rays will not
interfere with the first.<a name='FA_227' id='FA_227' href='#FN_227' class='fnanchor'>[227]</a>

How alone must our life be lived! We dwell on the

Each one marches in the van. The weakest child is

Parents and relations but entertain the youth; they cannot

before him to the bounds of space.

What is fame to a living man? If he live aright, the

<i>March 15.</i> When I have access to a man's barrel of
sermons, which were written from week to week, as
his life lapsed, though I now know him to live cheerfully
and bravely enough, still I cannot conceive what
interval there was for laughter and smiles in the midst
of so much sadness. Almost in proportion to the sincerity
and earnestness of the life will be the sadness of
the record. When I reflect that twice a week for so many
years he pondered and preached such a sermon, I think
he must have been a splenetic and melancholy man,
and wonder if his food digested well. It seems as if the
fruit of virtue was never a careless happiness.

A great cheerfulness have all great wits possessed,

not, but their religion had the broader basis in proportion
as it was less prominent. The religion I love is
very laic. The clergy are as diseased, and as much
possessed with a devil, as the reformers. They make
their topic as offensive as the politician, for our religion
is as unpublic and incommunicable as our poetical
vein, and to be approached with as much love and
tenderness.

my friend's generosity when he bestows a gift is an additional
favor to be grateful for.
</p>

<p class="p2">
<i>March 27. Saturday.</i> Magnanimity, though it look expensive
for a short course, is always economy in the long
run. Be generous in your poverty, if you would be rich.
To make up a great action there are no subordinate
mean ones. We can never afford to postpone a true life
to-day to any future and anticipated nobleness. We
think if by tight economy we can manage to arrive at
independence, then indeed we will begin to be generous
without stay. We sacrifice all nobleness to a little
present meanness. If a man charges you eight hundred
pay him eight hundred and fifty, and it will leave a
clean edge to the sum. It will be like nature, overflowing
and rounded like the bank of a river, not close and
precise like a drain or ditch.

It is always a short step to peace—of mind.

I must not lose any of my freedom by being a farmer
and landholder. Most who enter on any profession
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_242" name="Page_242" href="#Page_242">242</a></span>
are doomed men. The world might as well sing a dirge
over them forthwith. The farmer's muscles are rigid.
He can do one thing long, not many well. His pace
seems determined henceforth; he never quickens it.
A very rigid Nemesis is his fate. When the right wind
blows or a star calls, I can leave this arable and grass
ground, without making a will or settling my estate.
I would buy a farm as freely as a silken streamer. Let
me not think my front windows must face east henceforth
because a particular hill slopes that way. My life must
undulate still. I will not feel that my wings are clipped
when once I have settled on ground which the law calls
my own, but find new pinions grown to the old, and
talaria to my feet beside.

<p class="p2">
<i>March 30. Tuesday.</i> I find my life growing slovenly
when it does not exercise a constant supervision over
itself. Its duds accumulate. Next to having lived a day
well is a clear and calm overlooking of all our days.

<i>April 8.</i> Friends are the ancient and honorable of the
earth. The oldest men did not begin friendship. It is
older than Hindostan and the Chinese Empire. How
long has it been cultivated, and is still the staple article!
It is a divine league struck forever. Warm, serene days
only bring it out to the surface. There is a friendliness
between the sun and the earth in pleasant weather; the
gray content of the land is its color.

<i>April 9. Friday.</i> It would not be hard for some quiet
brave man to leap into the saddle to-day and eclipse
Napoleon's career by a grander,—show men at length
the meaning of war. One reproaches himself with supineness,
that he too has sat quiet in his chamber, and
not treated the world to the sound of the trumpet; that
the indignation which has so long rankled in his breast
does not take to horse and to the field. The bravest warrior
will have to fight his battles in his dreams, and no
earthly war note can arouse him. There are who would
not run with Leonidas. Only the third-rate Napoleons
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_247" name="Page_247" href="#Page_247">247</a></span>
and Alexanders does history tell of. The brave man does
not mind the call of the trumpet nor hear the idle clashing
of swords without, for the infinite din within. War
is but a training, compared with the active service of
his peace. Is he not at war? Does he not resist the ocean
swell within him, and walk as gently as the summer's
sea? Would you have him parade in uniform, and manœuvre
men, whose equanimity is his uniform and who
is himself manœuvred?

The times have no heart. The true reform can be

It calls no convention. I can do two thirds the reform

from ear to ear, for it is very pleasant to them. When an

How much virtue there is in simply seeing! We may
almost say that the hero has striven in vain for his pre-eminency,

Those still, piercing eyes, as faithfully exercised

Shakespeare. They may go to Asia with parade, or to

fairyland, but not beyond her ray. We are as much as

<i>April 15. Thursday.</i> The gods are of no sect; they
side with no man. When I imagine that Nature inclined
rather to some few earnest and faithful souls, and specially
existed for them, I go to see an obscure individual
who lives under the hill, letting both gods and men
alone, and find that strawberries and tomatoes grow
for him too in his garden there, and the sun lodges kindly
under his hillside, and am compelled to acknowledge
the unbribable charity of the gods.

Any simple, unquestioned mode of life is alluring to

confess I am startled to find everywhere the old system

of things so grim and assured. Wherever I go the farms
are run out, and there they lie, and the youth must buy
old land and bring it to. Everywhere the relentless opponents
of reform are a few old maids and bachelors,
who sit round the kitchen fire, listening to the singing

farmer,—as she simply satisfies a want of the body.
Some interests have got a footing on the earth which I
have not made sufficient allowance for. That which built
these barns and cleared the land thus had some valor.<a name='FA_236' id='FA_236' href='#FN_236' class='fnanchor'>[236]</a>

We take little steps, and venture small stakes, as if

no swing to our deeds. But our life is only a retired
valley where we rest on our packs awhile. Between

<p class="p2">
<i>April 24.</i> Music is the sound of the circulation in
nature's veins. It is the flux which melts nature. Men
dance to it, glasses ring and vibrate, and the fields seem
to undulate. The healthy ear always hears it, nearer or
more remote.

immense leisure and duration.

<p>
When I hear a robin sing at sunset, I cannot help
contrasting the equanimity of Nature with the bustle
and impatience of man. We return from the lyceum
and caucus with such stir and excitement, as if a
crisis were at hand; but no natural scene or sound
sympathizes with us, for Nature is always silent and
unpretending as at the break of day. She but rubs
her eyelids.

<p>
The charm of the Indian to me is that he stands free
and unconstrained in Nature, is her inhabitant and not
her guest, and wears her easily and gracefully. But the
civilized man has the habits of the house. His house is
a prison, in which he finds himself oppressed and confined,
not sheltered and protected. He walks as if he
sustained the roof; he carries his arms as if the walls
would fall in and crush him, and his feet remember the
cellar beneath. His muscles are never relaxed. It is rare
that he overcomes the house, and learns to sit at home
in it, and roof and floor and walls support themselves,
as the sky and trees and earth.

It is a great art to saunter.

<p class="p2">
<i>April 27.</i> It is only by a sort of voluntary blindness,
and omitting to see, that we know ourselves, as when
we see stars with the side of the eye. The nearest
approach to discovering what we are is in dreams. It
is as hard to see one's self as to look backwards without
turning round. And foolish are they that look in
glasses with that intent.

The porters have a hard time, but not so hard as he
that carries his own shoulders. That beats the Smyrna
Turks. Some men's broad shoulders are load enough.
Even a light frame can stand under a great burden, if
it does not have to support itself. Virtue is buoyant
and elastic; it stands without effort and does not feel
gravity; but sin plods and shuffles. Newton needed not
to wait for an apple to fall to discover the attraction
of gravitation; it was implied in the fall of man.
</p>

<p class="p2">
<i>April 28. Wednesday.</i> We falsely attribute to men a
determined character; putting together all their yesterdays
and averaging them, we presume we know them.
Pity the man who has a character to support. It is
worse than a large family. He is silent poor indeed. But
in fact character is never explored, nor does it get developed
in time, but eternity is its development, time its
envelope. In view of this distinction, a sort of divine
politeness and heavenly good breeding suggests itself,
to address always the enveloped character of a man.
I approach a great nature with infinite expectation and
uncertainty, not knowing what I may meet. It lies as
broad and unexplored before me as a scraggy hillside
or pasture. I may hear a fox bark, or a partridge drum,
or some bird new to these localities may fly up. It lies
out there as old, and yet as new. The aspect of the
woods varies every day, what with their growth and the
changes of the seasons and the influence of the elements,
so that the eye of the forester never twice rests upon the
same prospect. Much more does a character show
newly and variedly, if directly seen. It is the highest
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_255" name="Page_255" href="#Page_255">255</a></span>
compliment to suppose that in the intervals of conversation
your companion has expanded and grown. It may
be a deference which he will not understand, but the
nature which underlies him will understand it, and your
influence will be shed as finely on him as the dust in
the sun settles on our clothes. By such politeness we
may educate one another to some purpose. So have
I felt myself educated sometimes; I am expanded and
enlarged.
</p>

<p class="p2">
<i>April 29.</i> Birds and quadrupeds pass freely through
nature, without prop or stilt. But man very naturally
carries a stick in his hand, seeking to ally himself by
many points to nature, as a warrior stands by his horse's
side with his hand on his mane. We walk the gracefuler
for a cane, as the juggler uses a leaded pole to balance
him when he dances on a slack wire.

Better a monosyllabic life than a ragged and muttered

<i>April 30.</i> Where shall we look for standard English
but to the words of any man who has a depth of feeling

the gentlemanly windows of the country-seat no sincere

horn windows a true glance and greeting occasionally.

<i>May 3. Monday.</i> We are all pilots of the most intricate
Bahama channels. Beauty may be the sky overhead,
but Duty is the water underneath. When I see a
man with serene countenance in the sunshine of summer,
drinking in peace in the garden or parlor, it looks
like a great inward leisure that he enjoys; but in reality
he sails on no summer's sea, but this steady sailing comes
of a heavy hand on the tiller. We do not attend to larks
and bluebirds so leisurely but that conscience is as erect
as the attitude of the listener. The man of principle gets
never a holiday. Our true character silently underlies
all our words and actions, as the granite underlies the
other strata. Its steady pulse does not cease for any
deed of ours, as the sap is still ascending in the stalk
of the fairest flower.
</p>

<p class="p2">
<i>May 6. Thursday.</i> The fickle person is he that does
not know what is true or right absolutely,—who has
not an ancient wisdom for a lifetime, but a new prudence
for every hour. We must sail by a sort of dead
reckoning on this course of life, not speak any vessel
nor spy any headland, but, in spite of all phenomena,
come steadily to port at last. In general we must have
a catholic and universal wisdom, wiser than any particular,
and be prudent enough to defer to it always.
We are literally wiser than we know. Men do not fail
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_258" name="Page_258" href="#Page_258">258</a></span>
for want of knowledge, but for want of prudence to give
wisdom the preference.<a name='FA_243' id='FA_243' href='#FN_243' class='fnanchor'>[243]</a> These low weathercocks on
barns and fences show not which way the general and
steady current of the wind sets,—which brings fair
weather or foul,—but the vane on the steeple, high
up in another stratum of atmosphere, tells that. What
we need to know in any case is very simple.<a name='FA_244' id='FA_244' href='#FN_244' class='fnanchor'>[244]</a> I shall not
mistake the direction of my life; if I but know the high
land and the main,—on this side the Cordilleras, on
that the Pacific,—I shall know how to run. If a ridge
intervene, I have but to seek, or make, a gap to the sea.

<i>May 9. Sunday.</i> The pine stands in the woods like an
Indian,—untamed, with a fantastic wildness about it,
even in the clearings. If an Indian warrior were well
painted, with pines in the background, he would seem to
blend with the trees, and make a harmonious expression.
The pitch pines are the ghosts of Philip and Massasoit.
The white pine has the smoother features of the squaw.

<p class="p2">
The poet speaks only those thoughts that come unbidden,
like the wind that stirs the trees, and men cannot
help but listen. He is not listened to, but heard.
The weathercock might as well dally with the wind as
a man pretend to resist eloquence. The breath that
inspires the poet has traversed a whole Campagna,
and this new climate here indicates that other latitudes
are chilled or heated.

</p>

<p>
Books are to be attended to as new sounds merely.
Most would be put to a sore trial if the reader should assume
the attitude of a listener. They are but a new note
in the forest. To our lonely, sober thought the earth is a
wild unexplored. Wildness as of the jay and muskrat
reigns over the great part of nature. The oven-bird and
plover are heard in the horizon. Here is a new book of
heroes, come to me like the note of the chewink from over
the fen, only over a deeper and wider fen. The pines
are unrelenting sifters of thought; nothing petty leaks
through them. Let me put my ear close, and hear the
sough of this book, that I may know if any inspiration
yet haunts it. There is always a later edition of every book
than the printer wots of, no matter how recently it was
published. All nature is a new impression every instant.
</p>

<p class="p2">
The aspects of the most simple object are as various
as the aspects of the most compound. Observe the same
sheet of water from different eminences. When I have
travelled a few miles I do not recognize the profile of the
hills of my native village.

<p class="p2">
<i>May 27. Thursday.</i> I sit in my boat on Walden, playing
the flute this evening, and see the perch, which I
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_261" name="Page_261" href="#Page_261">261</a></span>
seem to have charmed, hovering around me, and the
moon travelling over the bottom, which is strewn with
the wrecks of the forest, and feel that nothing but the
wildest imagination can conceive of the manner of life
we are living. Nature is a wizard. The Concord nights
are stranger than the Arabian nights.
</p>

<p>
We not only want elbow-room, but eye-room in this
gray air which shrouds all the fields. Sometimes my eyes
see over the county road by daylight to the tops of yonder
birches on the hill, as at others by moonlight.
</p>

<p>
Heaven lies above, because the air is deep.

<p class="p2">
In all my life hitherto I have left nothing behind.

<i>May 31. Monday.</i> That title, "The Laws of Menu<a name='FA_248' id='FA_248' href='#FN_248' class='fnanchor'>[248]</a>
with the Gloss of Culluca," comes to me with such a
volume of sound as if it had swept unobstructed over the
plains of Hindostan; and when my eye rests on yonder
birches, or the sun in the water, or the shadows of the
trees, it seems to signify the laws of them all. They are
the laws of you and me, a fragrance wafted down from
those old times, and no more to be refuted than the wind.

When my imagination travels eastward and backward
to those remote years of the gods, I seem to draw near
to the habitation of the morning, and the dawn at length
has a place. I remember the book as an hour before

<i>June 1.</i> To have seen a man out of the East or West is
sufficient to establish their reality and locality. I have
seen a Mr. Wattles to-day, from Vermont, and now
know where that is and that it is; a reformer, with two
soldier's eyes and shoulders, who began to belabor the
world at ten years, a ragged mountain boy, as fifer of a
company, with set purpose to remould it from those first
years.

<i>June 2. Wednesday.</i> I am brought into the near neighborhood
and am become a silent observer of the moon's
paces to-night, by means of a glass, while the frogs are
peeping all around me on the earth, and the sound of
the accordion seems to come from some bright saloon
yonder. I am sure the moon floats in a human atmosphere.
It is but a distant scene of the world's drama.
It is a wide theatre the gods have given us, and our
actions must befit it. More sea and land, mountain and
valley, here is,—a further West, a freshness and wildness
in reserve when all the land shall be cleared.
</p>

<p>
I see three little lakes between the hills near its edge,
reflecting the sun's rays. The light glimmers as on the
water in a tumbler. So far off do the laws of reflection
hold. I seem to see the ribs of the creature. This is the
aspect of their day, its outside,—their heaven above
their heads, towards which they breathe their prayers.
So much is between me and them. It is noon there,
perchance, and ships are at anchor in the havens or
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_263" name="Page_263" href="#Page_263">263</a></span>
sailing on the seas, and there is a din in the streets,
and in this light or that shade some leisurely soul contemplates.

But now dor-bugs fly over its disk and bring me back

<p class="p2">
<i>June 7. Monday.</i> The inhabitants of those Eastern
plains seem to possess a natural and hereditary right
to be conservative and magnify forms and traditions.
"Immemorial custom is transcendent law," says Menu.
That is, it was the custom of gods before men used it.
The fault of our New England custom is that it is
memorial. What is morality but immemorial custom?
It is not manner but character, and the conservative
conscience sustains it.<a name='FA_249' id='FA_249' href='#FN_249' class='fnanchor'>[249]</a>
</p>

<p>
We are accustomed to exaggerate the immobility
and stagnation of those eras, as of the waters which
levelled the steppes; but those slow revolving "years
of the gods" were as rapid to all the needs of virtue as
these bustling and hasty seasons. Man stands to revere,
he kneels to pray. Methinks history will have to be tried
by new tests to show what centuries were rapid and what
slow. Corn grows in the night.<a name='FA_250' id='FA_250' href='#FN_250' class='fnanchor'>[250]</a> Will this bustling era
detain the future reader longer? Will the earth seem
to have conversed more with the heavens during these
times? Who is writing better Vedas? How science and
art spread and flourished, how trivial conveniences were
multiplied, that which is the gossip of the world is not
recorded in them; and if they are left out of our scripture,
too, what will remain?

Since the Battle of Bunker Hill we think the world

When I remember the treachery of memory and the
manifold accidents to which tradition is liable, how soon
the vista of the past closes behind,—as near as night's
crescent to the setting day,—and the dazzling brightness
of noon is reduced to the faint glimmer of the evening
star, I feel as if it were by a rare indulgence of the
fates that any traces of the past are left us,—that my
ears which do not hear across the interval over which
a crow caws should chance to hear this far-travelled
sound. With how little coöperation of the societies,
after all, is the past remembered!
</p>

<p class="p2">
I know of no book which comes to us with grander
pretensions than the "Laws of Menu;" and this immense
presumption is so impersonal and sincere that
it is never offensive or ridiculous. Observe the modes
in which modern literature is advertised, and then consider
this Hindoo prospectus. Think what a reading
public it addresses, what criticism it expects. What
wonder if the times were not ripe for it?<a name='FA_251' id='FA_251' href='#FN_251' class='fnanchor'>[251]</a>

A slight sound at evening lifts me up by the ears, and
makes life seem inexpressibly serene and grand. It may
be in Uranus, or it may be in the shutter. It is the
original sound of which all literature is but the echo. It
makes all fear superfluous. Bravery comes from further
than the sources of fear.

<i>Aug. 1. Sunday.</i> I never met a man who cast a free
and healthy glance over life, but the best live in a sort
of Sabbath light, a Jewish gloom. The best thought is
not only without sombreness, but even without morality.
The universe lies outspread in floods of white light to it.
The moral aspect of nature is a jaundice reflected from
man. To the innocent there are no cherubim nor angels.
Occasionally we rise above the necessity of virtue into
an unchangeable morning light, in which we have not
to choose in a dilemma between right and wrong, but
simply to live right on and breathe the circumambient
air.<a name='FA_253' id='FA_253' href='#FN_253' class='fnanchor'>[253]</a> There is no name for this life unless it be the very

still unintelligible, as from beyond a depth in me which
I have not fathomed, where my future lies folded up. I
hear several faint notes, quite outside me, which populate
the waste.

<p>
I cannot read a sentence in the book of the Hindoos
without being elevated as upon the table-land of the
Ghauts. It has such a rhythm as the winds of the
desert, such a tide as the Ganges, and seems as superior
to criticism as the Himmaleh Mounts. Even at this
late hour, unworn by time, with a native and inherent
dignity it wears the English dress as indifferently as the
Sanscrit. The great tone of the book is of such fibre and
such severe tension that no time nor accident can relax
it.<a name='FA_254' id='FA_254' href='#FN_254' class='fnanchor'>[254]</a> The great thought is never found in a mean dress,
but is of virtue to ennoble any language. Let it issue
from the lips of the Wolofs, or from the forum of Rome,
the nine Muses will seem to have been purveyors for it.
Its education is always liberal; it has all the graces of
oratory and of poetry. The lofty tone which is its indispensable
breath is grace to the eye and music to the
ear. It can endow a college.<a name='FA_255' id='FA_255' href='#FN_255' class='fnanchor'>[255]</a>

So supremely religious a book imposes with authority
on the latest age. The very simplicity of style of the
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_267" name="Page_267" href="#Page_267">267</a></span>
ancient lawgiver, implying all in the omission of all,
proves an habitual elevation of thought, which the multiplied
glosses of later days strive in vain to slope up to.
The whole book by noble gestures and inclinations seems
to render words unnecessary. The abbreviated sentence
points to the thing for explanation. As the sublimest
thought is most faithfully printed in the face, and needs
the fewest interpreting words. The page nods toward
the fact and is silent.

As I walk across the yard from the barn to the house
through the fog, with a lamp in my hand, I am reminded
of the Merrimack nights, and seem to see the
sod between tent-ropes. The trees, seen dimly through
the mist, suggest things which do not at all belong to
the past, but are peculiar to my fresh New England
life. It is as novel as green peas. The dew hangs everywhere
upon the grass, and I breathe the rich, damp air

Any book of great authority and genius seems to our
imagination to permeate and pervade all space. Its
spirit, like a more subtle ether, sweeps along with the
prevailing winds of the country. Its influence conveys
a new gloss to the meadows and the depths of the wood,
and bathes the huckleberries on the hills, as sometimes
a new influence in the sky washes in waves over the
fields and seems to break on some invisible beach in
the air. All things confirm it. It spends the mornings

Everywhere the speech of Menu demands the widest

I read history as little critically as I consider the landscape,
and am more interested in the atmospheric tints
and various lights and shades which the intervening
spaces create than in its groundwork and composition.
It is the morning now turned evening and seen in the
west,—the same sun, but a new light and atmosphere.
Its beauty is like the sunset; not a fresco painting on a
wall, flat and bounded, but atmospheric and roving,
or free. But, in reality, history fluctuates as the face
of the landscape from morning to evening. What is of
moment in it is its hue and color. Time hides no treasures;
we want not its <i>then</i>, but its <i>now</i>. We do not complain
that the mountains in the horizon are blue and
indistinct; they are the more like the heavens.

Of what moment are facts that can be lost,—which
need to be commemorated? The monument of death
will outlast the memory of the dead. The Pyramids do
not tell the tale confided to them. The living fact commemorates
itself. Why look in the dark for light? Look
in the light rather. Strictly speaking, the Societies have
not recovered one fact from oblivion, but they themselves
are instead of the fact that is lost. The researcher
is more memorable than the researched. The crowd
stood admiring the mist and the dim outline of the trees
seen through it, and when one of their number advanced
to explore the phenomenon, with fresh admiration all
eyes were turned on his dimly retreating figure. Critical
acumen is exerted in vain to uncover the past; the
<i>past</i> cannot be <i>presented</i>; we cannot know what we are
not. But one veil hangs over past, present, and future,
and it is the province of the historian to find out, not
what was, but what is. Where a battle has been fought,
you will find nothing but the bones of men and beasts;
where a battle is being fought, there are hearts beating.
We will sit on a mound and muse, and not try to make
these skeletons stand on their legs again. Does Nature
remember, think you, that they <i>were</i> men, or not rather
that they <i>are</i> bones?
</p>

<p>
Ancient history has an air of antiquity. It should be
more modern. It is written as if the spectator should
be thinking of the back side of the picture on the wall,
as if the author expected the dead would be his readers,
and wished to detail to them their own experience.
Men seem anxious to accomplish an orderly retreat
through the centuries, earnestly rebuilding the works
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_270" name="Page_270" href="#Page_270">270</a></span>
behind, as they are battered down by the incroachments
of time; but while they loiter, they and their works
both fall a prey to the enemy.
</p>

<p>
Biography is liable to the same objection; it should
be autobiography. Let us not leave ourselves empty
that, so vexing our bowels, we may go abroad and be
somebody else to explain him. If I am not I, who will
be? As if it were to dispense justice to all. But the
time has not come for that.<a name='FA_258' id='FA_258' href='#FN_258' class='fnanchor'>[258]</a>

<i>Aug. 12.</i> We take pleasure in beholding the form of a
mountain in the horizon, as if by retiring to this distance
we had then first conquered it by our vision, and were
made privy to the design of the architect; so when we behold
the shadow of our earth on the moon's disk. When
we climb a mountain and observe the lesser irregularities,
we do not give credit to the comprehensive and general
intelligence which shaped them; but when we see the
outline in the horizon, we confess that the hand which
moulded those opposite slopes, making one balance the
other, worked round a deep centre, and was privy to the
plan of the universe. The smallest of nature's works fits
the farthest and widest view, as if it had been referred
in its bearings to every point in space.<a name='FA_259' id='FA_259' href='#FN_259' class='fnanchor'>[259]</a> It harmonizes

<i>Aug. 13. Friday.</i> I have been in the swamp by
Charles Miles's this afternoon, and found it so bosky
and sylvan that Art would never have freedom or courage
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_271" name="Page_271" href="#Page_271">271</a></span>
to imitate it. It can never match the luxury and
superfluity of Nature. In Art all is seen; she cannot
afford concealed wealth, and in consequence is niggardly;
but Nature, even when she is scant and thin
outwardly, contents us still by the assurance of a certain
generosity at the roots. Surely no stinted hand has
been at work here for these centuries to produce these
particular tints this summer. The double spruce attracts
me here, which I had hardly noticed in the gardens,

Nature has her luxurious and florid style as well as

my flute, and my music was a tinkling stream which
meandered with the river, and fell from note to note
as a brook from rock to rock. I did not hear the strains
after they had issued from the flute, but before they
were breathed into it, for the original strain precedes
the sound by as much as the echo follows after, and the
rest is the perquisite of the rocks and trees and beasts.<a name='FA_262' id='FA_262' href='#FN_262' class='fnanchor'>[262]</a>

Of all the duties of life it is hardest to be in earnest;
it implies a good deal both before and behind. I sit
here in the barn this flowing afternoon weather, while
the school bell is ringing in the village, and find that
all the things immediate to be done are very trivial.
I could postpone them to hear this locust sing. The
cockerels crow and the hens cluck in the yard as if time
were dog-cheap. It seems something worth detaining
time,—the laying of an egg. Cannot man do something
to comfort the gods, and not let the world prove
such a piddling concern? No doubt they would be
glad to sell their shares at a large discount by this time.

The landscape contains a thousand dials which indicate

has done its stent, and seems not to flow but lie at its

If I were awaked from a deep sleep, I should know
which side the meridian the sun might be by the chirping
of the crickets. Night has already insidiously set
her foot in the valley in many places, where the shadows
of the shrubs and fences begin to darken the landscape.
There is a deeper shading in the colors of the afternoon
landscape. Perhaps the forenoon is brighter than
the afternoon, not only because of the greater transparency
of the atmosphere then, but because we naturally
look most into the west,—as we look forward into the
day,—and so in the forenoon see the sunny side of
things, but in the afternoon the shadow of every tree.

The art which only gilds the surface and demands
merely a superficial polish, without reaching to the core,
is but varnish and filigree. But the work of genius is
rough-hewn from the first, because it anticipates the
lapse of time and has an ingrained polish, which still
appears when fragments are broken off, an essential
quality of its substance. Its beauty is its strength. It
breaks with a lustre, and splits in cubes and diamonds.
Like the diamond, it has only to be cut to be polished,
and its surface is a window to its interior splendors.

In the Hindoo scripture the idea of man is quite
illimitable and sublime. There is nowhere a loftier

himself, "the divine male." Indeed, the distinction of
races in this life is only the commencement of a series
of degrees which ends in Brahma.

The veneration in which the Vedas are held is itself

moral life of the Hindoo, and in such a case there is no
other truth than sincerity. Truth is such by reference
to the heart of man within, not to any standard without.
There is no creed so false but faith can make it true.

<i>Sept. 1. Wednesday.</i> When I observe the effeminate
taste of some of my contemporaries in this matter of
poetry, and how hardly they bear with certain incongruities,
I think if this age were consulted it would not
choose granite to be the backbone of the world, but
Bristol spar or Brazilian diamonds. But the verses
which have consulted the refinements even of a golden
age will be found weak and nerveless for an iron one.
The poet is always such a Cincinnatus in literature as
with republican simplicity to raise all to the chiefest
honors of the state.

<p>
Each generation thinks to inhabit only a west end
of the world, and have intercourse with a refined and
civilized Nature, not conceiving of her broad equality
and republicanism. They think her aristocratic and
exclusive because their own estates are narrow. But the
sun indifferently selects his rhymes, and with a liberal
taste weaves into his verse the planet and the stubble.<a name='FA_277' id='FA_277' href='#FN_277' class='fnanchor'>[277]</a>

<i>Sept. 2. Thursday.</i> There is but one obligation, and
that is the obligation to obey the highest dictate. None
can lay me under another which will supersede this.
The gods have given me these years without any incumbrance;
society has no mortgage on them. If any man
assist me in the way of the world, let him derive satisfaction
from the deed itself, for I think I never shall have
dissolved my prior obligations to God. Kindness repaid
is thereby annulled. I would let his deed lie as fair and
generous as it was intended. The truly beneficent never
relapses into a creditor; his great kindness is still extended
to me and is never done. Of those noble deeds
which have me for their object I am only the most fortunate
spectator, and would rather be the abettor of
their nobleness than stay their tide with the obstructions
of impatient gratitude. As true as action and reaction
are equal, that nobleness which was as wide as the
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_280" name="Page_280" href="#Page_280">280</a></span>
universe will rebound not on him the individual, but on
the world. If any have been kind to me, what more do
they want? I cannot make them richer than they are.
If they have not been kind, they cannot take from me the
privilege which they have not improved. My obligations
will be my lightest load, for that gratitude which is of
kindred stuff in me, expanding every pore, will easily
sustain the pressure. We walk the freest through the air
we breathe.
</p>

<p class="p2">
The sublime sentences of Menu carry us back to a
time when purification and sacrifice and self-devotion
had a place in the faith of men, and were not as now a
superstition. They contain a subtle and refined philosophy
also, such as in these times is not accompanied
with so lofty and pure a devotion.

I cannot read much of the best poetry in prose or
verse without feeling that it is a partial and exaggerated
plaint, rarely a carol as free as Nature's. That content
which the sun shines for between morning and evening
is unsung. The Muse solaces herself; she is not
delighted but consoled.<a name='FA_287' id='FA_287' href='#FN_287' class='fnanchor'>[287]</a> But there are times when we
feel a vigor in our limbs, and our thoughts are like a
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_284" name="Page_284" href="#Page_284">284</a></span>
flowing morning light, and the stream of our life without
reflection shows long reaches of serene ripples. And
if we were to sing at such an hour, there would be no
catastrophe contemplated in our verse, no tragic element
in it,<a name='FA_288' id='FA_288' href='#FN_288' class='fnanchor'>[288]</a> nor yet a comic. For the life of the gods is
not in any sense dramatic, nor can be the subject of the
drama; it is epic without beginning or end, an eternal
interlude without plot,—not subordinate one part to
another, but supreme as a whole, at once leaf and flower
and fruit. At present the highest strain is Hebraic.
The church bell is the tone of all religious thought, the
most musical that men consent to sing. In the youth
of poetry, men love to praise the lark and the morning,
but they soon forsake the dews and skies for the nightingale
and evening shades. Without instituting a wider
comparison I might say that in Homer there is more
of the innocence and serenity of youth than in the more
modern and moral poets. The Iliad is not Sabbath
but morning reading, and men cling to this old song,
because they have still moments of unbaptized and uncommitted
life which give them an appetite for more.

<i>Sept. 20. Monday.</i> Visited Sampson Wilder of Boston.
His method of setting out peach trees is as follows:—
</p>

<p>
Dig a hole six feet square and two deep, and remove
the earth; cover the bottom to the depth of six inches
with lime and ashes in equal proportions, and upon
this spread another layer of equal thickness, of horn
parings, tips of horns, bones, and the like, then fill up
with a compost of sod and strong animal manure, say
four bushels of hog manure to a cartload of sod. Cover
the tree—which should be budded at two years old—but
slightly, and at the end of two years dig a trench
round it three feet from the tree and six inches deep,
and fill it with lime and ashes.
</p>

<p>
For grapes:—
</p>

<p>
Let your trench be twelve feet wide and four deep,
cover the bottom with paving-stones six inches, then
old bricks with mortar attached or loose six inches more,
then beef-bones, horns, etc., six more (Captain Bobadil),
then a compost similar to the preceding. Set your roots
one foot from the north side, the trench running east
and west, and bury eight feet of the vine crosswise the
trench, not more than eight inches below the surface. Cut
it down for three or four years, that root may accumulate,
and then train it from the sun up an inclined plane.

<i>Nov. 29. Cambridge.</i>—One must fight his way, after
a fashion, even in the most civil and polite society. The
most truly kind and gracious have to be won by a sort
of valor, for the seeds of suspicion seem to lurk in every
spadeful of earth, as well as those of confidence. The
president and librarian turn the cold shoulder to your
application, though they are known for benevolent
persons. They wonder if you can be anything but a
thief, contemplating frauds on the library. It is the
instinctive and salutary principle of self-defense; that
which makes the cat show her talons when you take
her by the paw.<a name='FA_293' id='FA_293' href='#FN_293' class='fnanchor'>[293]</a>

<i>Nov. 30. Tuesday.</i> Cambridge.—When looking
over the dry and dusty volumes of the English poets, I
cannot believe that those fresh and fair creations I had
imagined are contained in them. English poetry from
Gower down, collected into one alcove, and so from the
library window compared with the commonest nature,
seems very mean. Poetry cannot breathe in the scholar's
atmosphere. The Aubreys and Hickeses, with all their
learning, prophane it yet indirectly by their zeal. You
need not envy his feelings who for the first time has
cornered up poetry in an alcove. I can hardly be serious
with myself when I remember that I have come
to Cambridge after poetry; and while I am running
over the catalogue and collating and selecting, I think
if it would not be a shorter way to a complete volume
to step at once into the field or wood, with a very low
reverence to students and librarians. Milton did not
foresee what company he was to fall into.<a name='FA_295' id='FA_295' href='#FN_295' class='fnanchor'>[295]</a> On running
over the titles of these books, looking from time
to time at their first pages or farther, I am oppressed
by an inevitable sadness. One must have come into a
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_289" name="Page_289" href="#Page_289">289</a></span>
library by an oriel window, as softly and undisturbed
as the light which falls on the books through a stained
window, and not by the librarian's door, else all his
dreams will vanish. Can the Valhalla be warmed by
steam and go by clock and bell?
</p>

<p>
Good poetry seems so simple and natural a thing that
when we meet it we wonder that all men are not always
poets. Poetry is nothing but healthy speech. Though
the speech of the poet goes to the heart of things, yet
he is that one especially who speaks civilly to Nature as
a second person and in some sense is the patron of the
world. Though more than any he stands in the midst
of Nature, yet more than any he can stand aloof from
her. The best lines, perhaps, only suggest to me that
that man simply saw or heard or felt what seems the
commonest fact in my experience.
</p>

<p>
One will know how to appreciate Chaucer best who
has come down to him the natural way through the very
meagre pastures of Saxon and ante-Chaucerian poetry.
So human and wise he seems after such diet that we
are as liable to misjudge him so as usually.<a name='FA_296' id='FA_296' href='#FN_296' class='fnanchor'>[296]</a>
</p>

<p class="p2">
The Saxon poetry extant seems of a more serious
and philosophical cast than the very earliest that can
be called English. It has more thought, but less music.
It translates Boëthius, it paraphrases the Hebrew Bible,
it solemnly sings of war, of life and death, and chronicles
events. The earliest English poetry is tinctured
with romance through the influence of the Normans, as
the Saxon was not. The ballad and metrical romance
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_290" name="Page_290" href="#Page_290">290</a></span>
belong to this period. Those old singers were for the
most part imitators or translators.<a name='FA_297' id='FA_297' href='#FN_297' class='fnanchor'>[297]</a> Or will it not
appear, when viewed at a sufficient distance, that our
brave new poets are also secondary as they, and refer
the eye that reads them and their poetry, too, back and
backward without end?

Nothing is so attractive and unceasingly curious as
character. There is no plant that needs such tender
treatment, there is none that will endure so rough. It
is the violet and the oak. It is the thing we mean, let
us say what we will. We mean our own character, or
we mean yours. It is divine and related to the heavens,
as the earth is by the flashes of the Aurora. It has no
acquaintance nor companion. It goes silent and unobserved
longer than any planet in space, but when at
length it does show itself, it seems like the flowering
of all the world, and its before unseen orbit is lit up
like the trail of a meteor. I hear no good news ever
but some trait of a noble character. It reproaches me
plaintively. I am mean in contrast, but again am
thrilled and elevated that I can see my own meanness,
and again still, that my own aspiration is realized
in that other. You reach me, my friend, not by your
kind or wise words to me here or there; but as you
retreat, perhaps after years of vain familiarity, some
gesture or unconscious action in the distance speaks
to me with more emphasis than all those years. I am
not concerned to know what eighth planet is wandering
in space up there, or when Venus or Orion rises,
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_291" name="Page_291" href="#Page_291">291</a></span>
but if, in any cot to east or west and set behind the
woods, there is any planetary character illuminating
the earth.

<i>[Dec.] 12. Sunday.</i> All music is only a sweet striving
to express character. Now that lately I have heard of
some traits in the character of a fair and earnest maiden
whom I had only known superficially, but who has
gone hence to make herself more known by distance,
they sound like strains of a wild harp music. They
make all persons and places who had thus forgotten her
to seem late and behindhand. Every maiden conceals
a fairer flower and more luscious fruit than any calyx
in the field, and if she go with averted face, confiding
in her own purity and high resolves, she will make the
heavens retrospective, and all nature will humbly confess
its queen.<a name='FA_299' id='FA_299' href='#FN_299' class='fnanchor'>[299]</a>

P. M. Walden.—I seem to discern the very form of
the wind when, blowing over the hills, it falls in broad
flakes upon the surface of the pond, this subtle element
obeying the same law with the least subtle. As it falls it
spreads itself like a mass of lead dropped upon an anvil.
I cannot help being encouraged by this blithe activity
in the elements in these degenerate days of men. Who
hears the rippling of the rivers will not utterly despair
of anything. The wind in the wood yonder sounds like
an incessant waterfall, the water dashing and roaring
among rocks.

entire action? Our energies pine for exercise. That

This ancient Scotch poetry, at which its contemporaries
so marvelled, sounds like the uncertain lisping
of a child. When man's speech flows freest it but stutters
and stammers. There is never a free and clear
deliverance; but, read now when the illusion of smooth
verse is destroyed by the antique spelling, the sense is
seen to stammer and stumble all the plainer. To how
few thoughts do all these sincere efforts give utterance!
An hour's conversation with these men would have done
more. I am astonished to find how meagre that diet
is which has fed so many men. The music of sound,
which is all-sufficient at first, is speedily lost, and then
the fame of the poet must rest on the music of the sense.
A great philosophical and moral poet would give permanence
to the language by making the best sound
convey the best sense.
</p>

<p class="p2">
<i>[Dec.] 14. Tuesday.</i> To hear the sunset described by
the old Scotch poet Douglas, as I have seen it, repays
me for many weary pages of antiquated Scotch. Nothing
so restores and humanizes antiquity and makes
it blithe as the discovery of some natural sympathy
between it and the present. Why is it that there is something
melancholy in antiquity? We forget that it had
any other future than our present. As if it were not as
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_295" name="Page_295" href="#Page_295">295</a></span>
near to <i>the</i> future as ourselves! No, thank heavens,
these ranks of men to right and left, posterity and ancestry,
are not to be thridded by any earnest mortal.
The heavens stood over the heads of our ancestors as
near as to us. Any living word in their books abolishes
the difference of time. It need only be considered from
the present standpoint.

<i>[Dec.] 15. Wednesday.</i> A mild summer sun shines
over forest and lake. The earth looks as fair this morning
as the Valhalla of the gods. Indeed our spirits never
go beyond nature. In the woods there is an inexpressible
happiness. Their mirth is but just repressed. In
winter, when there is but one green leaf for many rods,
what warm content is in them! They are not rude, but
tender, even in the severest cold. Their nakedness is
their defense. All their sounds and sights are elixir to
my spirit. They possess a divine health. God is not
more well. Every sound is inspiriting and fraught with
the same mysterious assurance, from the creaking of
the boughs in January to the soft sough of the wind in
July.
</p>

<p>
How much of my well-being, think you, depends on
the condition of my lungs and stomach,—such cheap
pieces of Nature as they, which, indeed, she is every
day reproducing with prodigality. Is the arrow indeed
fatal which rankles in the breast of the bird on the
bough, in whose eye all this fair landscape is reflected,
and whose voice still echoes through the wood?

The trees have come down to the bank to see the river

only the channel is the same.<a name='FA_300' id='FA_300' href='#FN_300' class='fnanchor'>[300]</a> The water which so
calmly reflects the fleeting clouds and the primeval
trees I have never seen before. It may have washed
some distant shore, or framed a glacier or iceberg at
the north, when I last stood here. Seen through a mild
atmosphere, the works of the husbandman, his plowing
and reaping, have a beauty to the beholder which
the laborer never sees.<a name='FA_301' id='FA_301' href='#FN_301' class='fnanchor'>[301]</a>

<p>
I seem to see somewhat more of my own kith and
kin in the lichens on the rocks than in any books. It
does seem as if mine were a peculiarly wild nature,
which so yearns toward all wildness. I know of no
redeeming qualities in me but a sincere love for some
things, and when I am reproved I have to fall back on
to this ground.<a name='FA_302' id='FA_302' href='#FN_302' class='fnanchor'>[302]</a> This is my argument in reserve for all
cases. My love is invulnerable. Meet me on that ground,
and you will find me strong. When I am condemned,
and condemn myself utterly, I think straightway, "But
I rely on my love for some things." Therein I am whole
and entire. Therein I am God-propped.

When I see the smoke curling up through the woods
from some farmhouse invisible, it is more suggestive
of the poetry of rural and domestic life than a nearer
inspection can be. Up goes the smoke as quietly as the
dew exhales in vapor from these pine leaves and oaks;
as busy, disposing itself in circles and in wreaths, as the
housewife on the hearth below. It is cotemporary with
a piece of human biography, and waves as a feather in
some <i>man's</i> cap. Under that rod of sky there is some
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_297" name="Page_297" href="#Page_297">297</a></span>
plot a-brewing, some ingenuity has planted itself, and
we shall see what it will do. It tattles of more things
than the boiling of the pot. It is but one of man's
breaths. All that is interesting in history or fiction is
transpiring beneath that cloud. The subject of all life
and death, of happiness and grief, goes thereunder.

<i>[Dec.] 18. Saturday.</i> Some men make their due impression
upon their generation, because a petty occasion
is enough to call forth all their energies; but are there
not others who would rise to much higher levels, whom
the world has never provoked to make the effort? I believe
there are men now living who have never opened
their mouths in a public assembly, in whom nevertheless
there is such a well of eloquence that the appetite
of any age could never exhaust it; who pine for an
occasion worthy of them, and will pine till they are dead;
who can admire, as well as the rest, at the flowing speech
of the orator, but do yet miss the thunder and lightning
and visible sympathy of the elements which would garnish
their own utterance.
</p>

<p>
If in any strait I see a man fluttered and his ballast
gone, then I lose all hope of him, he is undone; but if
he reposes still, though he do nothing else worthy of
him, if he is still a man in reserve, then is there everything
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_298" name="Page_298" href="#Page_298">298</a></span>
to hope of him. The age may well go pine itself
that it cannot put to use this gift of the gods. He lives
on, still unconcerned, not needing to be used. The
greatest occasion will be the slowest to come.
</p>

<p class="p2">
Sometimes a particular body of men do unconsciously
assert that their will is fate, that the right is decided
by their fiat without appeal, and when this is the case
they can never be mistaken; as when one man is quite
silenced by the thrilling eloquence of another, and submits
to be neglected as to his fate, because such is not
the willful vote of the assembly, but their instinctive
decision.

A forest is in all mythologies a sacred place, as the

and "Sherwood." Had Robin Hood no Sherwood to
resort [to], it would be difficult to invest his story with
the charms it has got. It is always the tale that is untold,
the deeds done and the life lived in the unexplored

of a summer day or a winter night. When I hear this
bell ring, I am carried back to years and Sabbaths when
I was newer and more innocent, I fear, than now, and
it seems to me as if there were a world within a world.
Sin, I am sure, is not in overt acts or, indeed, in acts of
any kind, but is in proportion to the time which has
come behind us and displaced eternity,—that degree
to which our elements are mixed with the elements of
the world. The whole duty of life is contained in the

hand of the farmer. The daily work is too often toughening
the pericarp of the heart as well as the hand.
Great familiarity with the world must be nicely managed,
lest it win away and bereave us of some susceptibility.
Experience bereaves us of our innocence; wisdom bereaves
us of our ignorance. Let us walk in the world
without learning its ways. Whole weeks or months of
my summer life slide away in thin volumes like mist or

its shadow flitting across the fields, which have caught
a new significance from that accident; and as that

amber inciting men to lives of as limpid purity. Then
do other parts of my day's work shine than I had thought
at noon, for I discover the real purport of my toil, as,
when the husbandman has reached the end of the furrow
and looks back, he can best tell where the pressed
earth shines most.<a name='FA_309' id='FA_309' href='#FN_309' class='fnanchor'>[309]</a>

All true greatness runs as level a course, and is as
unaspiring, as the plow in the furrow. It wears the
homeliest dress and speaks the homeliest language.
Its theme is gossamer and dew lines, johnswort and
loosestrife, for it has never stirred from its repose and
is most ignorant of foreign parts. Heaven is the inmost
place. The good have not to travel far. What cheer
may we not derive from the thought that our courses do
not diverge, and we wend not asunder, but as the web
of destiny is woven it [is] fulled, and we are cast more
and more into the centre! And our fates even are social.<a name='FA_310' id='FA_310' href='#FN_310' class='fnanchor'>[310]</a>
There is no wisdom which can take [the] place
of humanity, and I find that in old Chaucer that love
rings longest which rhymes best with some saw of Milton's
or Edmunds's. I wish I could be as still as God
is. I can recall to my mind the stillest summer hour,
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_302" name="Page_302" href="#Page_302">302</a></span>
in which the grasshopper sings over the mulleins, and
there is a valor in that time the memory of which is
armor that can laugh at any blow of fortune. A man
should go out [of] nature with the chirp of the cricket or
the trill of the veery ringing in his ear. These earthly
sounds should only die away for a season, as the strains
of the harp rise and swell. Death is that expressive
pause in the music of the blast.<a name='FA_311' id='FA_311' href='#FN_311' class='fnanchor'>[311]</a> I would be as clean as
ye, O woods. I shall not rest till I be as innocent as you.
I know that I shall sooner or later attain to an unspotted
innocence, for when I consider that state even now I
am thrilled.

<p>
If we were wise enough, we should see to what virtue
we were indebted for any happier moment we might
have, nor doubt we had earned this at some time.
</p>

<p>
These motions everywhere in nature must surely
[be] the circulations of God. The flowing sail, the running
stream, the waving tree, the roving wind,—whence
else their infinite health and freedom?<a name='FA_312' id='FA_312' href='#FN_312' class='fnanchor'>[312]</a> I can see nothing
so proper and holy as unrelaxed play and frolic
in this bower God has built for us. The suspicion of sin
never comes to this thought. Oh, if men felt this they
would never build temples even of marble or diamond,
but it would be sacrilege and prophane, but disport them
forever in this paradise.
</p>

<p>
In the coldest day it melts somewhere.

<p>
It seems as if only one trait, one little incident in
human biography, need to be said or written in some
era, that all readers may go mad after it, and the man
who did the miracle is made a demigod henceforth.

What we all do, not one can tell; and when some lucky
speaker utters a truth of our experience and not of our
speculation, we think he must have had the nine Muses
and the three Graces to help him. I can at length
stretch me when I come to Chaucer's breadth; and I
think, "Well, I could be <i>that</i> man's acquaintance,"<a name='FA_313' id='FA_313' href='#FN_313' class='fnanchor'>[313]</a>
for he walked in that low and retired way that I do,
and was not too good to live. I am grieved when they
hint of any unmanly submissions he may have made,
for that subtracts from his breadth and humanity.
</p>

<p class="p2">
<i>Dec. 30. Thursday.</i> I admire Chaucer for a sturdy
English wit. The easy height he speaks from in his
Prologue to the Canterbury Tales is as good as anything
in it,—as if he were indeed better than any of
the company there assembled.<a name='FA_314' id='FA_314' href='#FN_314' class='fnanchor'>[314]</a>
</p>

<p>
The poet does not have to go out of himself and cease
to tattle of his domestic affairs, to win our confidence,
but is so broad that we see no limits to his sympathy.
</p>

<p>
Great delicacy and gentleness of character is constantly
displayed in Chaucer's verse. The simplest and
humblest words come readily to his lips. The natural
innocence of the man appears in the simple and pure
spirit in which "The Prioresses Tale" is conceived, in
which the child sings <i><span lang="la">O alma redemptoris mater</span></i>, and in
the account of the departure of Custance with her child
upon the sea, in "The Man of Lawes Tale."<a name='FA_315' id='FA_315' href='#FN_315' class='fnanchor'>[315]</a> The
whole story of Chanticleer and Dame Partlet in "The
Nonnes Preestes Tale" is genuine humanity. I know
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_304" name="Page_304" href="#Page_304">304</a></span>
nothing better in its kind. The poets seem to be only
more frank and plain-spoken than other men. Their
verse is but confessions. They always confide in the
reader, and speak privily with him, keeping nothing
back.<a name='FA_316' id='FA_316' href='#FN_316' class='fnanchor'>[316]</a>

<p>
I know of no safe rule by which to judge of the
purity of a former age but that I see that the impure of
the present age are not apt to rise to noble sentiments
when they speak or write, and suspect, therefore, that
there may be more truth than is allowed in the apology
that such was the manner of the age.<a name='FA_317' id='FA_317' href='#FN_317' class='fnanchor'>[317]</a>

<p>Within the circuit of this plodding life,</p>

<p>On every twig and rail and jutting spout</p>

<p>Some summer accident long past</p>
<p>Of lakelet gleaming in the July beams,</p>
<p>Or hum of bee under the blue flag,</p>
<p>Loitering in the meads, or busy rill</p>
<p>which now stands dumb and still,</p>
<p>its own memorial, purling at its play along the slopes,</p>
<p>and through the meadows next, till that its sound was</p>

In memory is the more reality. I have seen how the
furrows shone but late upturned, and where the fieldfare
followed in the rear, when all the fields stood bound
and hoar beneath a thick integument of snow.<a name='FA_318' id='FA_318' href='#FN_318' class='fnanchor'>[318]</a>
</p>

<p class="p2">
When the snow is falling thick and fast, the flakes
nearest you seem to be driving straight to the ground,
while the more distant seem to float in the air in a quivering
bank, like feathers, or like birds at play, and not
as if sent on any errand. So, at a little distance, all the
works of Nature proceed with sport and frolic. They
are more in the eye and less in the deed.
</p>

<p class="p2">
<i>Dec. 31. Friday.</i> Books of natural history make the
most cheerful winter reading. I read in Audubon with
a thrill of delight, when the snow covers the ground,
of the magnolia, and the Florida keys, and their warm
sea breezes; of the fence-rail, and the cotton-tree, and
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_306" name="Page_306" href="#Page_306">306</a></span>
the migrations of the rice-bird; or of the breaking up
of winter in Labrador. I seem to hear the melting of the
snow on the forks of the Missouri as I read. I imbibe
some portion of health from these reminiscences of
luxuriant nature.
</p>

<p>
There is a singular health for me in those words
Labrador and East Main which no desponding creed
recognizes. How much more than federal are these
States! If there were no other vicissitudes but the seasons,
with their attendant and consequent changes, our
interest would never flag. Much more is a-doing than
Congress wots of in the winter season. What journal
do the persimmon and buckeye keep, or the sharp-shinned
hawk? What is transpiring from summer to
winter in the Carolinas, and the Great Pine Forest, and
the Valley of the Mohawk? The merely political aspect
of the land is never very cheering. Men are degraded
when considered as the members of a political organization.
As a nation the people never utter one great
and healthy word. From this side all nations present
only the symptoms of disease. I see but Bunker's Hill
and Sing Sing, the District of Columbia and Sullivan's
Island, with a few avenues connecting them. But paltry
are all these beside one blast of the east or south wind
which blows over them all.
</p>

<p>
In society you will not find health, but in nature.
You must converse much with the field and woods, if
you would imbibe such health into your mind and spirit
as you covet for your body. Society is always diseased,
and the best is the sickest. There is no scent in it so
wholesome as that of the pines, nor any fragrance so
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_307" name="Page_307" href="#Page_307">307</a></span>
penetrating and restorative as that of everlasting in
high pastures. Without that our feet at least stood in
the midst of nature, all our faces would be pale and
livid.
</p>

<p>
I should like to keep some book of natural history
always by me as a sort of elixir, the reading of which
would restore the tone of my system and secure me
true and cheerful views of life. For to the sick, nature
is sick, but to the well, a fountain of health. To the
soul that contemplates some trait of natural beauty no
harm nor disappointment can come. The doctrines of
despair, of spiritual or political servitude, no priestcraft
nor tyranny, was ever [<i>sic</i>] taught by such as drank in
the harmony of nature.<a name='FA_319' id='FA_319' href='#FN_319' class='fnanchor'>[319]</a>

<i>Jan. 1.</i> Virtue is the deed of the bravest. It is that
art which demands the greatest confidence and fearlessness.
Only some hardy soul ventures upon it. Virtue
is a bravery so hardy that it deals in what it has no
experience in. The virtuous soul possesses a fortitude
and hardihood which not the grenadier nor pioneer
can match. It never shrunk. It goes singing to its work.
Effort is its relaxation. The rude pioneer work of this
world has been done by the most devoted worshippers
of beauty.<a name='FA_320' id='FA_320' href='#FN_320' class='fnanchor'>[320]</a> Their resolution has possessed a keener
edge than the soldier's. In winter is their campaign;
they never go into quarters. They are elastic under the
heaviest burden, under the extremest physical suffering.
</p>

<p>
Methinks good courage will not flag here on the Atlantic
border as long as we are outflanked by the <i>Fur
Countries</i>. There is enough in that sound to cheer one
under any circumstances. The spruce, the hemlock,
and the pine will not countenance despair. Methinks
some creeds in vestries and churches do forget the
hunter wrapped in furs by the Great Slave Lake, or
how the Esquimaux sledges are drawn by dogs, and
in the twilight of the northern night the hunter does
not give over to follow the seal and walrus over the
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_309" name="Page_309" href="#Page_309">309</a></span>
ice. These men are sick and of diseased imaginations
who would toll the world's knell so soon. Cannot these
sedentary sects do better than prepare the shrouds and
write the epitaphs of those other busy living men?
The practical faith of men belies the preacher's consolation.

<p>
There is no infidelity so great as that which prays,
and keeps the Sabbath, and founds churches. The
sealer of the South Pacific preaches a truer doctrine.
The church is the hospital for men's souls, but the reflection
that he may one day occupy a ward in it should
not discourage the cheerful labors of the able-bodied
man. Let him remember the sick in their extremities,
but not look thither as to his goal.<a name='FA_322' id='FA_322' href='#FN_322' class='fnanchor'>[322]</a>

<p class="p2">
<i>Jan. 2. Sunday.</i> The ringing of the church bell is a
much more melodious sound than any that is heard
within the church. All great values are thus public, and
undulate like sound through the atmosphere. Wealth
cannot purchase any great private solace or convenience.
Riches are only the means of sociality. I will depend on
the extravagance of my neighbors for my luxuries, for
they will take care to pamper me if I will be overfed.
The poor man who sacrificed nothing for the gratification
seems to derive a safer and more natural enjoyment
from his neighbor's extravagance than he does himself.
It is a new natural product, from the contemplation of
which he derives new vigor and solace as from a natural
phenomenon.

<p>
In moments of quiet and leisure my thoughts are
more apt to revert to some natural than any human
relation.
</p>

<p>
Chaucer's sincere sorrow in his latter days for the
grossness of his earlier works, and that he "cannot
recall and annul" what he had "written of the base and
filthy love of men towards women; but alas they are
now continued from man to man," says he, "and I
cannot do what I desire," is all very creditable to his
character.
</p>

<p>
Chaucer is the make-weight of his century,—a
worthy representative of England while Petrarch and
Boccaccio lived in Italy, and Tell and Tamerlane in
Switzerland and Asia, and Bruce and Rienzi in Europe,
and Wickliffe and Gower in his own land. Edward III
and John of Gaunt and the Black Prince complete the
company. The fame of Roger Bacon came down from
the preceding century, and Dante, though just departed,
still exerted the influence of a living presence.<a name='FA_323' id='FA_323' href='#FN_323' class='fnanchor'>[323]</a>
</p>

<p>
With all his grossness he is not undistinguished for the
tenderness and delicacy of his muse. A simple pathos
and feminine gentleness is peculiar to him which not
even Wordsworth can match.<a name='FA_324' id='FA_324' href='#FN_324' class='fnanchor'>[324]</a> And then his best passages
of length are marked by a happy and healthy wit
which is rather rare in the poetry of any nation. On the
whole, he impresses me as greater than his reputation,
and not a little like Homer and Shakespeare, for he
would have held up his head in their company. Among
the earliest English poets he is their landlord and host,
and has the authority of such. We read him with affection
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_311" name="Page_311" href="#Page_311">311</a></span>
and without criticism, for he pleads no cause, but
speaks for us, his readers, always. He has that greatness
of trust and reliance which compels popularity. He is for
a whole country and country [<i>sic</i>] to know and to be
proud of. The affectionate mention which succeeding
early poets make of him, coupling him with Homer and
Virgil, is also to be taken into the account in estimating
his character. King James and Dunbar of Scotland
speak with more love and reverence of him than any
cotemporary poet of his predecessors of the last century.
That childlike relation, indeed, does not seem to exist
now which was then.<a name='FA_325' id='FA_325' href='#FN_325' class='fnanchor'>[325]</a>
</p>

<p class="p2">
<i>Jan. 3. Monday.</i> It is pleasant when one can relieve
the grossness of the kitchen and the table by the simple
beauty of his repast, so that there may be anything in it
to attract the eye of the artist even. I have been popping
corn to-night, which is only a more rapid blossoming of
the seed under a greater than July heat. The popped
corn is a perfect winter flower, hinting of anemones and
houstonias. For this little grace man has, mixed in with
the vulgarness of his repast, he may well thank his stars.
The law by which flowers unfold their petals seems only
to have operated more suddenly under the intense heat.
It looks like a sympathy in this seed of the corn with its
sisters of the vegetable kingdom, as if by preference it
assumed the flower form rather than the crystalline.
Here has bloomed for my repast such a delicate blossom
as will soon spring by the wall-sides. And this is as it
should be. Why should not Nature revel sometimes, and
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_312" name="Page_312" href="#Page_312">312</a></span>
genially relax and make herself familiar at my board?
I would have my house a bower fit to entertain her. It
is a feast of such innocence as might have snowed down.
By my warm hearth sprang these cerealious blossoms;
here was the bank where they grew.
</p>

<p>
Methinks some such visible token of approval would
always accompany the simple and healthy repast.
There would be such a smiling and blessing upon it.
Our appetite should always be so related to our taste,
and the board we spread for its gratification be an
epitome of the universal table which Nature sets by hill
and wood and stream for her dumb pensioners.<a name='FA_326' id='FA_326' href='#FN_326' class='fnanchor'>[326]</a>
</p>

<p class="p2">
<i>Jan. 5. Wednesday.</i> I find that whatever hindrances
may occur I write just about the same amount of truth
in my Journal; for the record is more concentrated, and
usually it is some very real and earnest life, after all, that
interrupts. All flourishes are omitted. If I saw wood
from morning to night, though I grieve that I could not
observe the train of my thoughts during that time, yet,
in the evening, the few scrannel lines which describe
my day's occupations will make the creaking of the saw
more musical than my freest fancies could have been. I
find incessant labor with the hands, which engrosses the
attention also, the best method to remove palaver out of
one's style. One will not dance at his work who has
wood to cut and cord before the night falls in the short
days of winter; but every stroke will be husbanded, and
ring soberly through the wood; and so will his lines
ring and tell on the ear, when at evening he settles the
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_313" name="Page_313" href="#Page_313">313</a></span>
accounts of the day. I have often been astonished at
the force and precision of style to which busy laboring
men, unpracticed in writing, easily attain when they
are required to make the effort. It seems as if their
sincerity and plainness were the main thing to be taught
in schools,—and yet not in the schools, but in the
fields, in actual service, I should say. The scholar not
unfrequently envies the propriety and emphasis with
which the farmer calls to his team, and confesses that
if that lingo were written it would surpass his labored
sentences.
</p>

<p>
Who is not tired of the weak and flowing periods of
the politician and scholar, and resorts not even to the
Farmer's Almanac, to read the simple account of the
month's labor, to restore his tone again? I want to see
a sentence run clear through to the end, as deep and
fertile as a well-drawn furrow which shows that the
plow was pressed down to the beam. If our scholars
would lead more earnest lives, we should not witness
those lame conclusions to their ill-sown discourses, but
their sentences would pass over the ground like loaded
rollers, and not mere hollow and wooden ones, to press
in the seed and make it germinate.
</p>

<p>
A well-built sentence, in the rapidity and force with
which it works, may be compared to a modern corn-planter,
which furrows out, drops the seed, and covers it
up at one movement.<a name='FA_327' id='FA_327' href='#FN_327' class='fnanchor'>[327]</a>
</p>

<p>
The scholar requires hard labor as an impetus to his
pen. He will learn to grasp it as firmly and wield it as
gracefully and effectually as an axe or a sword. When
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_314" name="Page_314" href="#Page_314">314</a></span>
I consider the labored periods of some gentleman
scholar, who perchance in feet and inches comes up to
the standard of his race, and is nowise deficient in
girth, I am amazed at the immense sacrifice of thews
and sinews. What! these proportions and these bones,
and this their work! How these hands hewed this
fragile matter, mere filagree or embroidery fit for
ladies' fingers! Can this be a stalwart man's work, who
has marrow in his backbone and a tendon Achilles
in his heel? They who set up Stonehenge did somewhat,—much
in comparison,—if it were only their
strength was once fairly laid out, and they stretched
themselves.<a name='FA_328' id='FA_328' href='#FN_328' class='fnanchor'>[328]</a>
</p>

<p>
I discover in Raleigh's verses the vices of the courtier.
They are not equally sustained, as if his noble genius
were warped by the frivolous society of the court. He
was capable of rising to a remarkable elevation. His
poetry has for the most part a heroic tone and vigor as of
a knight errant. But again there seems to have been
somewhat unkindly in his education, and as if he had by
no means grown up to be the man he promised. He was
apparently too genial and loyal a soul, or rather he was
incapable of resisting temptations from that quarter.
If to his genius and culture he could have added the
temperament of Fox or Cromwell, the world would have
had cause longer to remember him. He was the pattern
of nobility. One would have said it was by some lucky
fate that he and Shakespeare flourished at the same
time in England, and yet what do we know of their
acquaintanceship?

<p>
The great God is very calm withal. How superfluous
is any excitement in his creatures! He listens equally
to the prayers of the believer and the unbeliever. The
moods of man should unfold and alternate as gradually
and placidly as those of nature. The sun shines for aye!
The sudden revolutions of these times and this generation
have acquired a very exaggerated importance.
They do not interest me much, for they are not in harmony
with the longer periods of nature. The present, in
any aspect in which it can be presented to the smallest
audience, is always mean. God does not sympathize
with the popular movements.

<p class="p2">
<i>Jan. 8. Saturday.</i> When, as now, in January a south
wind melts the snow, and the bare ground appears,
covered with sere grass and occasionally wilted green
leaves which seem in doubt whether to let go their
greenness quite or absorb new juices against the coming
year,—in such a season a perfume seems to exhale
from the earth itself and the south wind melts my integuments
also. Then is she my mother earth. I derive
a real vigor from the scent of the gale wafted over the
naked ground, as from strong meats, and realize again
how man is the pensioner of Nature. We are always
conciliated and cheered when we are fed by [such] an
influence, and our needs are felt to be part of the
domestic economy of Nature.

What offends me most in my compositions is the
moral element in them. The repentant say never a
brave word. Their resolves should be mumbled in
silence. Strictly speaking, morality is not healthy.
Those undeserved joys which come uncalled and make
us more pleased than grateful are they that sing.

One music seems to differ from another chiefly in its
more perfect time, to use this word in a true sense. In
the steadiness and equanimity of music lies its divinity.
It is the only assured tone.<a name='FA_330' id='FA_330' href='#FN_330' class='fnanchor'>[330]</a> When men attain to speak
with as settled a faith and as firm assurance, their voices
will sing and their feet march as do the feet of the
soldier. The very dogs howl if time is disregarded.
Because of the perfect time of this music-box—its
harmony with itself—is its greater dignity and stateliness.
This music is more nobly related for its more exact
measure. So simple a difference as this more even pace
raises it to the higher dignity.
</p>

<p>
Man's progress through nature should have an accompaniment
of music. It relieves the scenery, which is seen
through it as a subtler element, like a very clear morning
air in autumn. Music wafts me through the clear,
sultry valleys, with only a slight gray vapor against the
hills.
</p>

<p>
Of what manner of stuff is the web of time wove,
when these consecutive sounds called a strain of music
can be wafted down through the centuries from Homer
to me, and Homer have been conversant with that same
unfathomable mystery and charm which so newly
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_317" name="Page_317" href="#Page_317">317</a></span>
tingles my ears?<a name='FA_331' id='FA_331' href='#FN_331' class='fnanchor'>[331]</a> These single strains, these melodious
cadences which plainly proceed out of a very deep
meaning and a sustained soul, are the interjections of
God. They are perhaps the expression of the perfect
knowledge which the righteous at length attain to. Am
I so like thee, my brother, that the cadence of two notes
affects us alike? Shall I not some time have an opportunity
to thank him who made music? I feel a sad cheer
when I hear these lofty strains,<a name='FA_332' id='FA_332' href='#FN_332' class='fnanchor'>[332]</a> because there must be
something in me as lofty that hears. But ah, I hear them
but rarely! Does it not rather hear me? If my blood
were clogged in my veins, I am sure it would run more
freely. God must be very rich, who, for the turning of a
pivot, can pour out such melody on me. It is a little
prophet; it tells me the secrets of futurity. Where are
its secrets wound up but in this box?<a name='FA_333' id='FA_333' href='#FN_333' class='fnanchor'>[333]</a> So much hope
had slumbered. There are in music such strains as
far surpass any faith in the loftiness of man's destiny.<a name='FA_334' id='FA_334' href='#FN_334' class='fnanchor'>[334]</a>
He must be very sad before he can comprehend them.
The clear, liquid notes from the morning fields beyond
seem to come through a vale of sadness to man, which
gives all music a plaintive air. It hath caught a higher
pace than any virtue I know. It is the arch-reformer.
It hastens the sun to his setting. It invites him to his
rising. It is the sweetest reproach, a measured satire.
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_318" name="Page_318" href="#Page_318">318</a></span>
I know there is a people somewhere [where] this heroism
has place. Or else things are to be learned which
it will be sweet to learn.<a name='FA_335' id='FA_335' href='#FN_335' class='fnanchor'>[335]</a> This cannot be all rumor.
When I hear this, I think of that everlasting and
stable something which is not sound, but to be a thrilling
reality, and can consent to go about the meanest
work for as many years of time as it pleases even the
Hindoo penance, for a year of the gods were as nothing
to that which shall come after. What, then, can I do
to hasten that other time, or that space where there
shall be no time, and these things be a more living part
of my life,—where there will be no discords in my
life?

<i>Jan. 9. Sunday.</i> One cannot too soon forget his errors
and misdemeanors; for [to] dwell long upon them is to
add to the offense, and repentance and sorrow can only
be displaced by somewhat better, and which is as free
and original as if they had not been. Not to grieve long
for any action, but to go immediately and do freshly and
otherwise, subtracts so much from the wrong. Else we
may make the delay of repentance the punishment of
the sin. But a great nature will not consider its sins as
its own, but be more absorbed in the prospect of that
valor and virtue for the future which is more properly
it, than in those improper actions which, by being sins,
discover themselves to be not it.

Sir W. Raleigh's faults are those of a courtier and
a soldier. In his counsels and aphorisms we see not
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_319" name="Page_319" href="#Page_319">319</a></span>
unfrequently the haste and rashness of a boy. His
philosophy was not wide nor deep, but continually
giving way to the generosity of his nature. What he
touches he adorns by his greater humanity and native
nobleness, but he touches not the true nor original.
He thus embellishes the old, but does not unfold the
new. He seems to have been fitted by his genius for short
flights of impulsive poetry, but not for the sustained
loftiness of Shakespeare or Milton. He was not wise nor
a seer in any sense, but rather one of nature's nobility;
the most generous nature which can be spared to linger
in the purlieus of the court.
</p>

<p>
His was a singularly perverted genius, with such an
inclination to originality and freedom, and yet who
never steered his own course. Of so fair and susceptible
a nature, rather than broad or deep, that he delayed to
slake his thirst at the nearest and even more turbid wells
of truth and beauty. Whose homage to the least fair
or noble left no space for homage to the all fair. The
misfortune of his circumstances, or rather of the man,
appears in the fact that he was the author of "Maxims
of State" and "The Cabinet Council" and "The Soul's
Errand."

how that the preparation for all issues is to do virtuously.

so that there was no progress for my own narrowness.
I cannot walk conveniently and pleasantly but when I
hold myself far off in the horizon. And the soul dilutes
the body and makes it passable. My soul and body have

<i>Feb. 23. Wednesday.</i> Every poet's muse is circumscribed
in her wanderings, and may be well said to
haunt some favorite spring or mountain. Chaucer
seems to have been the poet of gardens. He has hardly
left a poem in which some retired and luxurious retreat
of the kind is not described, to which he gains access by
some secret port, and there, by some fount or grove, is
found his hero and the scene of his tale. It seems as if,
by letting his imagination riot in the matchless beauty
of an ideal garden, he thus fed [<i>sic</i>] his fancy on to the
invention of a tale which would fit the scene. The muse
of the most universal poet retires into some familiar
nook, whence it spies out the land as the eagle from his
eyrie, for he who sees so far over plain and forest is
perched in a narrow cleft of the crag. Such pure childlike
love of Nature is nowhere to be matched.<a name='FA_339' id='FA_339' href='#FN_339' class='fnanchor'>[339]</a> And it is
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_323" name="Page_323" href="#Page_323">323</a></span>
not strange that the poetry of so rude an age should
contain such polished praise of Nature; for the charms
of Nature are not enhanced by civilization, as society is,
but she possesses a permanent refinement, which at last
subdues and educates men.
</p>

<p>
The reader has great confidence in Chaucer. He tells
no lies. You read his story with a smile, as if it were
the circumlocution of a child, and yet you find that he
has spoke with more directness and economy of words
than a sage. He is never heartless. So new was all his
theme in those days, that [he] had not to invent, but only
to tell.<a name='FA_340' id='FA_340' href='#FN_340' class='fnanchor'>[340]</a>

The language of poetry is <i>infantile</i>. It cannot talk.

True politeness is only hope and trust in men. It never
addresses a fallen or falling man, but salutes a rising
generation. It does not flatter, but only congratulates.
The rays of light come to us in such a curve that every

<i>March 2.</i> The greatest impression of character is
made by that person who consents to have no character.
He who sympathizes with and runs through the
whole circle of attributes cannot afford to be an individual.
Most men stand pledged to themselves, so that
their narrow and confined virtue has no suppleness.
They are like children who cannot walk in bad company
and learn the lesson which even it teaches, without their
guardians, for fear of contamination. He is a fortunate
man who gets through the world without being burthened
by a name and reputation, for they are at any
rate but his past history and no prophecy, and as such
concern him no more than another. Character is
Genius settled. It can maintain itself against the world,
and if it relapses it repents. It is as a dog set to watch
the property of Genius. Genius, strictly speaking, is
not responsible, for it is not moral.

Most lecturers preface their discourses on music
with a history of music, but as well introduce an essay

combinations of sound, the last wind that sighed, or
melody that waked the wood, had any history other
than a perceptive ear might hear in the least and latest
sound of nature! A history of music would be like the
history of the future; for so little past is it, and capable
of record, that it is but the hint of a prophecy. It is the
history of gravitation. It has no history more than God.
It circulates and resounds forever, and only flows like
the sea or air. There might be a history of men or of
hearing, but not of the unheard. Why, if I should sit
down to write its story, the west wind would rise to
refute me. Properly speaking, there can be no history
but natural history, for there is no past in the soul but
in nature. So that the history of anything is only the
true account of it, which will be always the same. I
might as well write the history of my aspirations. Does
not the last and highest contain them all? Do the lives
of the great composers contain the facts which interested
them? What is this music? Why, thinner and more
evanescent than ether; subtler than sound, for it is only
a disposition of sound. It is to sound what color is to
matter. It is the color of a flame, or of the rainbow, or
of water. Only one sense has known it. The least
profitable, the least tangible fact, which cannot be
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_326" name="Page_326" href="#Page_326">326</a></span>
bought or cultivated but by virtuous methods, and yet
our ears ring with it like shells left on the shore.

<i>March 11. Friday.</i> Chaucer's familiar, but innocent,
way of speaking of God is of a piece with his character.
He comes readily to his thoughts without any false reverence.
If Nature is our mother, is not God much
more? God should come into our thoughts with no more
parade than the zephyr into our ears. Only strangers
approach him with ceremony. How rarely in our English
tongue do we find expressed any affection for God!
No sentiment is so rare as love of God,—universal
love. Herbert is almost the only exception. "Ah, my
dear God," etc. Chaucer's was a remarkably affectionate
genius. There is less love and simple trust in Shakespeare.
When he sees a beautiful person or object, he
almost takes a pride in the "maistry" of his God.<a name='FA_344' id='FA_344' href='#FN_344' class='fnanchor'>[344]</a> The
Protestant Church seems to have nothing to supply the
place of the Saints of the Catholic calendar, who were
at least channels for the affections. Its God has perhaps
too many of the attributes of a Scandinavian deity.

We can only live healthily the life the gods assign us.
I must receive my life as passively as the willow leaf
that flutters over the brook. I must not be for myself,
but God's work, and that is always good. I will wait
the breezes patiently, and grow as Nature shall determine.
My fate cannot but be grand so. We may live
the life of a plant or an animal, without living an animal
life. This constant and universal content of the
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_327" name="Page_327" href="#Page_327">327</a></span>
animal comes of resting quietly in God's palm. I feel
as if [I] could at any time resign my life and the responsibility
of living into God's hands, and become as
innocent, free from care, as a plant or stone.
</p>

<p>
My life, my life! why will you linger? Are the years
short and the months of no account? How often has
long delay quenched my aspirations! Can God afford
that I should forget him? Is he so indifferent to my
career? Can heaven be postponed with no more ado?
Why were my ears given to hear those everlasting strains
which haunt my life, and yet to be prophaned much more
by these perpetual dull sounds?

<i>March 12.</i> Consider what a difference there is between
living and dying. To die is not to <i>begin</i> to die,
and <i>continue</i>; it is not a state of continuance, but of
transientness; but to live is a condition of continuance,
and does not mean to be born merely. There is no
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_328" name="Page_328" href="#Page_328">328</a></span>
continuance of death. It is a transient phenomenon.
Nature presents nothing in a state of death.

friends is soon incrusted over with sublime and pleasing
thoughts, as their monuments are overgrown with moss.<a name='FA_345' id='FA_345' href='#FN_345' class='fnanchor'>[345]</a>
Nature doth thus kindly heal every wound. By the
mediation of a thousand little mosses and fungi, the
most unsightly objects become radiant of beauty. There
seem to be two sides to this world, presented us at different
times, as we see things in growth or dissolution,
in life or death. For seen with the eye of a poet, as
God sees them, all are alive and beautiful; but seen
with the historical eye, or the eye of the memory, they
are dead and offensive. If we see Nature as pausing,
immediately all mortifies and decays; but seen as progressing,
she is beautiful.
</p>

<p class="p2">
I am startled that God can make me so rich even
with my own cheap stores. It needs but a few wisps of
straw in the sun, or some small word dropped, or that
has long lain silent in some book. When heaven begins

south wind will blow. What if you or I be dead! God

<i>March 14.</i> Chaucer's genius does not soar like Milton's,

<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_329" name="Page_329" href="#Page_329">329</a></span>
as Shakespeare, but the child of the English nation, but
that child that is "father of the man." His genius is
only for the most part an exceeding naturalness. It is
perfect sincerity, though with the behavior of a child
rather than of a man.<a name='FA_346' id='FA_346' href='#FN_346' class='fnanchor'>[346]</a> He can complain, as in the
"Testament of Love," but yet so truly and unfeignedly
that his complaint does not fail to interest. All England
has his case at heart.

<p>
He shows great tenderness and delicacy, but not the
heroic sentiment. His genius was feminine, not masculine,—not
but such is rarest to find in woman (though

It is not easy to find one brave enough to play the
game of love quite alone with you, but they must get
some third person, or world, to countenance them.
They thrust others between. Love is so delicate and
fastidious that I see not how [it] can ever begin. Do you
expect me to love with you, unless you make my love
secondary to nothing else? Your words come tainted,
if the thought of the world darted between thee and the
thought of me. You are not venturous enough for love.
It goes alone unscared through wildernesses.
</p>

<p>
As soon as I see people loving what they see merely,
and not their own high hopes that they form of others, I
pity, and do not want their love. Such love delays me.
Did I ask thee to love me who hate myself? No! Love
that I love, and I will love thee that lovest it.

world. "When I have done my quilting and baking,

Life is grand, and so are its environments of Past and
Future. Would the face of nature be so serene and
beautiful if man's destiny were not equally so? What
am I good for now, who am still marching after high
things, but to hear and tell the news, to bring wood and
water, and count how many eggs the hens lay? In the
meanwhile, I expect my life will begin. I will not aspire
longer. I will see what it is I would be after. I will be
unanimous.

of nature as my thought. They stay at home. I would
go home. When I get to the wood their thin leaves
rustle in my fingers. They are bare and obvious, and
there is no halo or haze about them. Nature lies far and
fair behind them all.<a name='FA_348' id='FA_348' href='#FN_348' class='fnanchor'>[348]</a> I should like to meet the great

Cold Spring.—I hear nothing but a phœbe, and the
wind, and the rattling of a chaise in the wood. For a
few years I stay here, not knowing, taking my own life
by degrees, and then I go. I hear a spring bubbling
near, where I drank out of a can in my earliest youth.
The birds, the squirrels, the alders, the pines, they seem
serene and in their places. I wonder if my life looks as
serene to them too. Does no creature, then, see with the
eyes of its own narrow destiny, but with God's? When
God made man, he reserved some parts and some rights
to himself. The eye has many qualities which belong
to God more than man. It is his lightning which flashes
in it. When I look into my companion's eye, I think
it is God's private mine. It is a noble feature; it cannot

simplest shellfish and pebbles on the beach; as if all
beauty resulted from an object turning on its own axis,
or others turning about it. It establishes a new centre
in the universe. As all curves have reference to their
centres or foci, so all beauty of character has reference
to the soul, and is a graceful gesture of recognition or
waving of the body toward it.

<p class="p2">
The great and solitary heart will love alone, without
the knowledge of its object. It cannot have society in its
love. It will expend its love as the cloud drops rain upon
the fields over which [it] floats.
</p>

<p>
The only way to speak the truth is to speak lovingly;
only the lover's words are heard. The intellect should
never speak; it is not a natural sound. How trivial the
best actions are! I am led about from sunrise to sunset
by an ignoble routine, and yet can find no better road.
I must make a part of the planet. I must obey the law
of nature.

<i>March 16. Wednesday.</i> Raleigh's Maxims are not true
and impartial, but yet are expressed with a certain magnanimity,
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_333" name="Page_333" href="#Page_333">333</a></span>
which was natural to the man, as if this selfish
policy could easily afford to give place in him to a more
human and generous. He gives such advice that we have
more faith in his conduct than his principles.
</p>

<p>
He seems to have carried the courtier's life to the
highest pitch of magnanimity and grace it was capable
of. He is liberal and generous as a prince,—that is,
within bounds; brave, chivalrous, heroic, as the knight
in armor and not as a defenseless man. His was not the
heroism of Luther, but of Bayard. There was more of
grace than of truth in it. He had more taste than character.
There may be something petty in a refined taste;
it easily degenerates into effeminacy; it does not consider
the broadest use. It is not content with simple
good and bad, and so is fastidious and curious, or nice
only.
</p>

<p class="p2">
The most attractive sentences are not perhaps the
wisest, but the surest and soundest. He who uttered
them had a right to speak. He did not stand on a rolling
stone, but was well assured of his footing, and naturally
breathed them without effort. They were spoken in the
nick of time. With rare fullness were they spoken, as a
flower expands in the field; and if you dispute their doctrine,
you will say, "But there is truth in their assurance."
Raleigh's are of this nature, spoken with entire
satisfaction and heartiness. They are not philosophy,
but poetry.
</p>

<p>
With him it was always well done and nobly said.
</p>

<p>
That is very true which Raleigh says about the equal
necessity of war and law,—that "the necessity of war,
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_334" name="Page_334" href="#Page_334">334</a></span>
which among human actions is most lawless, hath some
kind of affinity and near resemblance with the necessity
of law;" for both equally rest on force as their basis, and
war is only the resource of law, either on a smaller or
larger scale,—its authority asserted. In war, in some
sense, lies the very genius of law. It is law creative and
active; it is the first principle of the law. What is human
warfare but just this,—an effort to make the laws of
God and nature take sides with one party. Men make
an arbitrary code, and, because it is not right, they try
to make it prevail by might. The moral law does not
want any champion. Its asserters do not go to war. It
was never infringed with impunity. It is inconsistent
to decry war and maintain law, for if there were no need
of war there would be no need of law.
</p>

<p class="p2">
I must confess I see no resource but to conclude that
conscience was not given us to no purpose, or for a hindrance,
but that, however flattering order and expediency
may look, it is but the repose of a lethargy; and
we will choose rather to be awake, though it be stormy,
and maintain ourselves on this earth and in this life as
we may, without signing our death-warrant in the outset.
What does the law protect? My rights? or any rights?
My right, or the right? If I avail myself of it, it may help
my sin; it cannot help my virtue. Let us see if we cannot
stay here, where God has put us, on his own conditions.
Does not his law reach to the earth? While the law holds
fast the thief and murderer for my protection (I should
say its own), it lets itself go loose. Expediencies differ.
They may clash. English law may go to war with American
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_335" name="Page_335" href="#Page_335">335</a></span>
law, that is English interest with American interest,
but what is expedient for the whole world will be absolute
right, and synonymous with the law of God. So the
law is only partial right. It is selfish, and consults for the
interest of the few.<a name='FA_351' id='FA_351' href='#FN_351' class='fnanchor'>[351]</a>
</p>

<p>
Somehow, strangely, the vice of men gets well represented
and protected, but their virtue has none to plead
its cause, nor any charter of immunities and rights. The
Magna Charta is not chartered rights, but chartered
wrongs.

<i>March 17. Thursday.</i> I have been making pencils all
day, and then at evening walked to see an old schoolmate
who is going to help make the Welland Canal
navigable for ships round Niagara. He cannot see any
such motives and modes of living as I; professes not
to look beyond the securing of certain "creature comforts."
And so we go silently different ways, with all
serenity, I in the still moonlight through the village this
fair evening to write these thoughts in my journal, and
he, forsooth, to mature his schemes to ends as good,
maybe, but different. So are we two made, while the
same stars shine quietly over us. If I or he be wrong,
Nature yet consents placidly. She bites her lip and
smiles to see how her children will agree. So does the
Welland Canal get built, and other conveniences, while
I live. Well and good, I must confess. Fast sailing ships
are hence not detained.
</p>

<p>
What means this changing sky, that now I freeze and
contract and go within myself to warm me, and now I
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_336" name="Page_336" href="#Page_336">336</a></span>
say it is a south wind, and go all soft and warm along the
way? I sometimes wonder if I do not breathe the south
wind.

<i>March 18. Friday.</i> Whatever book or sentence will
bear to be read twice, we may be sure was thought twice.
I say this thinking of Carlyle, who writes pictures or first
impressions merely, which consequently will only bear a
first reading. As if any transient, any <i>new</i>, mood of the
best man deserved to detain the world long. I should call
Carlyle's writing essentially dramatic, excellent acting,
entertaining especially to those who see rather than those
who hear, not to be repeated more than a joke. If he did
not think who made the joke, how shall we think who
hear it? He never consults the oracle, but thinks to utter
oracles himself. There is nothing in his books for which
he is not, and does not feel, responsible. He does not
retire behind the truth he utters, but stands in the foreground.
I wish he would just think, and tell me what
he thinks, appear to me in the attitude of a man with
his ear inclined, who comes as silently and meekly as
the morning star, which is unconscious of the dawn it
heralds, leading the way up the steep as though alone
and unobserved in its observing, without looking behind.
He is essentially a humorist. But humors will
not feed a man; they are the least satisfactory morsel
to the healthy appetite. They circulate; I want rather
to meet that about which they circulate. The heart
is not a humor, nor do they go to the heart, as the
blood does.<a name='FA_352' id='FA_352' href='#FN_352' class='fnanchor'>[352]</a>

<i>March 19. Saturday</i>. When I walk in the fields of
Concord and meditate on the destiny of this prosperous
slip of the Saxon family, the unexhausted energies of
this new country, I forget that this which is now Concord
was once Musketaquid, and that the <i>American
race</i> has had its destiny also. Everywhere in the fields,
in the corn and grain land, the earth is strewn with the
relics of a race which has vanished as completely as if
trodden in with the earth. I find it good to remember
the eternity behind me as well as the eternity before.
Wherever I go, I tread in the tracks of the Indian. I
pick up the bolt which he has but just dropped at my
feet. And if I consider destiny I am on his trail. I scatter
his hearthstones with my feet, and pick out of the
embers of his fire the simple but enduring implements
of the wigwam and the chase. In planting my corn in
the same furrow which yielded its increase to his support
so long, I displace some memorial of him.
</p>

<p>
I have been walking this afternoon over a pleasant
field planted with winter rye, near the house, where this
strange people once had their dwelling-place. Another
species of mortal men, but little less wild to me than the
musquash they hunted. Strange spirits, dæmons, whose
eyes could never meet mine; with another nature and
another fate than mine. The crows flew over the edge
of the woods, and, wheeling over my head, seemed to
rebuke, as dark-winged spirits more akin to the Indian
than I. Perhaps only the present disguise of the Indian.
If the new has a meaning, so has the old.<a name='FA_353' id='FA_353' href='#FN_353' class='fnanchor'>[353]</a>
</p>

<p>
Nature has her russet hues as well as green. Indeed,
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_338" name="Page_338" href="#Page_338">338</a></span>
our eye splits on every object, and we can as well take
one path as the other. If I consider its history, it is old;
if its destiny, it is new. I may see a part of an object,
or the whole. I will not be imposed on and think Nature
is old because the season is advanced. I will study
the botany of the mosses and fungi on the decayed
[wood], and remember that decayed wood is not old,
but has just begun to be what it is. I need not think of
the pine almond<a name='FA_354' id='FA_354' href='#FN_354' class='fnanchor'>[354]</a> or the acorn and sapling when I meet
the fallen pine or oak, more than of the generations
of pines and oaks which have fed the young tree. The
new blade of the corn, the third leaf of the melon, these
are not green but gray with time, but sere in respect
of time.
</p>

<p>
The pines and the crows are not changed, but instead
that Philip and Paugus stand on the plain, here are
Webster and Crockett. Instead of the council-house
is the legislature. What a new aspect have new eyes
given to the land! Where is this country but in the
hearts of its inhabitants? Why, there is only so much
of Indian America left as there is of the American
Indian in the character of this generation.
</p>

<p class="p2">
A blithe west wind is blowing over all. In the fine
flowing haze, men at a distance seem shadowy and
gigantic, as ill-defined and great as men should always
be. I do not know if yonder be a man or a ghost.
</p>

<p class="p2">
What a consolation are the stars to man!—so high
and out of his reach, as is his own destiny. I do not know
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_339" name="Page_339" href="#Page_339">339</a></span>
but my life is fated to be thus low and grovelling always.
I cannot discover its use even to myself. But it is permitted
to see those stars in the sky equally useless, yet
highest of all and deserving of a fair destiny. My fate
is in some sense linked with that of the stars, and if they
are to persevere to a great end, shall I die who could
conjecture it? It surely is some encouragement to know
that the stars are my fellow-creatures, for I do not suspect
but they are reserved for a high destiny. Has not
he who discovers and names a planet in the heavens
as long a year as it? I do not fear that any misadventure
will befall <i>them</i>. Shall I not be content to disappear
with the missing stars? Do I mourn their fate?
</p>

<p>
Man's moral nature is a riddle which only eternity
can solve.
</p>

<p class="p2">
I see laws which never fail, of whose failure I never
conceived. Indeed I cannot detect failure anywhere but
in my fear. I do not fear that right is not right, that
good is not good, but only the annihilation of the present
existence. But only that can make me incapable of
fear. My fears are as good prophets as my hopes.

<p class="p2">
<i>March 20. Sunday</i>. My friend is cold and reserved
because his love for me is waxing and not waning. These
are the early processes; the particles are just beginning
to shoot in crystals. If the mountains came to me, I
should no longer go to the mountains. So soon as that
consummation takes place which I wish, it will be past.
Shall I not have a friend in reserve? Heaven is to come.
I hope this is not it.
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_340" name="Page_340" href="#Page_340">340</a></span>
</p>
<p>
Words should pass between friends as the lightning
passes from cloud to cloud. I don't know how much
I assist in the economy of nature when I declare a fact.
Is it not an important part in the history of the flower
that I tell my friend where I found it? We do [not]
wish friends to feed and clothe our bodies,—neighbors
are kind enough for that,—but to do the like offices to
ourselves.<a name='FA_355' id='FA_355' href='#FN_355' class='fnanchor'>[355]</a> We wish to spread and publish ourselves,
as the sun spreads its rays; and we toss the new thought
to the friend, and thus it is dispersed. Friends are those
twain who feel their interests to be one. Each knows
that the other might as well have said what he said.
All beauty, all music, all delight springs from apparent
dualism but real unity. My friend is my real brother.
I see his nature groping yonder like my own. Does there
go one whom I know? then I go there.
</p>

<p>
The field where friends have met is consecrated forever.
Man seeks friendship out of the desire to realize
a home here. As the Indian thinks he receives into himself
the courage and strength of his conquered enemy,
so we add to ourselves all the character and heart of our
friends. He is my creation. I can do what I will with
him. There is no possibility of being thwarted; the friend
is like wax in the rays that fall from our own hearts.
</p>

<p>
The friend does not take my word for anything, but
he takes me. He trusts me as I trust myself. We only
need be as true to others as we are to ourselves, that
there may be ground enough for friendship. In the
beginnings of friendship,—for it does not grow,—we
realize such love and justice as are attributed to God.
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_341" name="Page_341" href="#Page_341">341</a></span>
</p>
<p>
Very few are they from whom we derive any <i>in</i>formation.
The most only announce and tell tales, but
the friend <i>in</i>-forms.
</p>

<p>
What is all nature and human life at this moment,
what the scenery and vicinity of a human soul, but the
song of an early sparrow from yonder fences, and the
cackling hens in the barn? So for one while my destiny
loiters within ear-shot of these sounds. The great busy
Dame Nature is concerned to know how many eggs her
hens lay. The Soul, the proprietor of the world, has an
interest in the stacking of hay, the foddering of cattle,
and the draining of peat meadows. Away in Scythia,
away in India, they make butter and cheese for its
larder.<a name='FA_356' id='FA_356' href='#FN_356' class='fnanchor'>[356]</a> I wish that in some page of the Testament there
were something like Charlemagne's egg account. Was
not Christ interested in the setting hens of Palestine?
</p>

<p>
Nature is very ample and roomy. She has left us
plenty of space to move in. As far as I can see from this
window, how little life in the landscape! The few birds
that flit past do not crowd; they do not fill the valley.
The traveller on the highway has no fellow-traveller
for miles before or behind him. Nature was generous
and not niggardly, certainly.
</p>

<p class="p2">
How simple is the natural connection of events. We
complain greatly of the want of flow and sequence in
books, but if the journalist only move himself from
Boston to New York, and speak as before, there is link
enough. And so there would be, if he were as careless
of connection and order when he stayed at home, and
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_342" name="Page_342" href="#Page_342">342</a></span>
let the incessant progress which his life makes be the
apology for abruptness. Do I not travel as far away
from my old resorts, though I stay here at home, as
though I were on board the steamboat? Is not my life
riveted together? Has not it sequence? Do not my
breathings follow each other naturally?

I have not succeeded if I have an antagonist who

<p>
I cannot think nor utter my thought unless I have
infinite room. The cope of heaven is not too high, the
sea is not too deep, for him who would unfold a great
thought. It must feed me and warm and clothe me. It
must be an entertainment to which my whole nature is
invited. I must know that the gods are to be my fellow-guests.

<i>March 23. Wednesday.</i> Plain speech is always a desideratum.
Men write in a florid style only because they
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_343" name="Page_343" href="#Page_343">343</a></span>
would match the simple beauties of the plainest speech.
They prefer to be misunderstood, rather than come
short of its exuberance. Hussein Effendi praises the
epistolary style of Ibrahim Pasha to the French traveller
Botta, because of "the difficulty of understanding it:
there was, he said, but one person at Jidda who was
capable of understanding and explaining the Pasha's
correspondence." A plain sentence, where every word
is rooted in the soil, is indeed flowery and verdurous.
It has the beauty and variety of mosaic with the strength
and compactness of masonry. All fullness looks like
exuberance. We are not rich without superfluous
wealth; but the imitator only copies the superfluity.
If the words were sufficiently simple and answering to
the thing to be expressed, our sentences would be as
blooming as wreaths of evergreen and flowers.<a name='FA_358' id='FA_358' href='#FN_358' class='fnanchor'>[358]</a> You
cannot fill a wine-glass quite to the brim without heaping
it. Simplicity is exuberant.
</p>

<p>
When I look back eastward over the world, it seems
to be all in repose. Arabia, Persia, Hindostan are the
land of contemplation. Those Eastern nations have
perfected the luxury of idleness. Mount Sabér, according
to the French traveller and naturalist Botta, is
celebrated for producing the Kát tree. "The soft tops
of the twigs and tender leaves are eaten," says his reviewer,
"and produce an agreeable soothing excitement,
restoring from fatigue, banishing sleep, and disposing
to the enjoyment of conversation." What could be more
dignified than to browse the tree-tops with the camelopard?
Who would not be a rabbit or partridge sometimes,
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_344" name="Page_344" href="#Page_344">344</a></span>
to chew mallows and pick the apple tree buds?
It is not hard to discover an instinct for the opium and
betel and tobacco chewers.<a name='FA_359' id='FA_359' href='#FN_359' class='fnanchor'>[359]</a>

<p class="p2">
After all, I believe it is the style of thought entirely,
and not the style of expression, which makes the difference
in books. For if I find any thought worth extracting,
I do not wish to alter the language. Then the
author seems to have had all the graces of eloquence
and poetry given him.
</p>

<p>
I am pleased to discover myself as much a pensioner
in Nature as moles and titmice. In some very direct
and simple uses to which man puts Nature he stands
in this relation to her. Oriental life does not want this
grandeur. It is in Sadi and the Arabian Nights and the
Fables of Pilpay. In the New England noontide I have
discovered more materials of Oriental history than the
Sanskrit contains or Sir W. Jones has unlocked. I see
why it is necessary there should be such history at all.
Was not Asia mapped in my brain before it was in any
geography? In my brain is the Sanskrit which contains
the history of the primitive times. The Vedas and their
Angas are not so ancient as my serenest contemplations.<a name='FA_360' id='FA_360' href='#FN_360' class='fnanchor'>[360]</a>
My mind contemplates them, as Brahma his scribe.

<p class="p2">
I occasionally find myself to be nothing at all, because
the gods give me nothing to do. I cannot brag; I can

It is seen in this old scripture how wisdom is older
than the talent of composition. It is a simple and not a
compound rock. The story is as slender as the thread on
which pearls are strung; it is a spiral line, growing more
and more perplexed till it winds itself up and dies like the
silkworm in its cocoon. It is an interminable labyrinth.
It seems as if the old philosopher could not talk without
moving, and each motion were made the apology or
occasion for a sentence, but, this being found inconvenient,
the fictitious progress of the tale was invented.
The story which winds between and around these sentences,
these barrows in the desert, these oases, is as
indistinct as a camel track between Mourzuk and Darfur,
between the Pyramids and the Nile, from Gaza to
Jaffa.<a name='FA_364' id='FA_364' href='#FN_364' class='fnanchor'>[364]</a>

The great thoughts of a wise man seem to the vulgar
who do not generalize to stand far apart like isolated
mounts; but science knows that the mountains which
rise so solitary in our midst are parts of a great mountain-chain,
dividing the earth, and the eye that looks into the
horizon toward the blue Sierra melting away in the distance
may detect their flow of thought. These sentences
which take up your common life so easily are not seen
to run into ridges, because they are the table-land on
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_347" name="Page_347" href="#Page_347">347</a></span>
which the spectator stands.<a name='FA_365' id='FA_365' href='#FN_365' class='fnanchor'>[365]</a> I do not require that the
mountain-peaks be chained together, but by the common
basis on which they stand, nor that the path of the
muleteer be kept open at so much pains, when they may
be bridged by the Milky Way. That they stand frowning
upon one another, or mutually reflecting the sun's
rays, is proof enough of their common basis.

The book should be found where the sentence is, and
its connection be as inartificial. It is the inspiration of a
day and not of a moment. The links should be gold
also. Better that the good be not united than that a bad
man be admitted into their society. When men can
select they will. If there be any stone in the quarry better
than the rest, they will forsake the rest because of it.
Only the good will be quarried.

How insufficient is all wisdom without love! There
may be courtesy, there may be good will, there may be
even temper, there may be wit, and talent, and sparkling
conversation,—and yet the soul pine for life. Just so
sacred and rich as my life is to myself will it be to
another. Ignorance and bungling with love are better
than wisdom and skill without. Our life without love is
like coke and ashes,—like the cocoanut in which the
milk is dried up. I want to see the sweet sap of living
wood in it. Men may be pure as alabaster and Parian
marble, elegant as a Tuscan villa, sublime as Terni, but
if they are not in society as retiring and inexperienced
as children, we shall go join Alaric and the Goths and
Vandals. There is no milk mixed with the wine at the
entertainment.<a name='FA_369' id='FA_369' href='#FN_369' class='fnanchor'>[369]</a>

<p>
Enthusiasm which is the formless material of thought.
Comparatively speaking, I care not for the man or his
designs who would make the highest use of me short
of an all-adventuring friendship. I wish by the behavior
of my friend toward me to be led to have such
regard for myself as for a box of precious ointment. I
shall not be so cheap to myself if I see that another
values me.
</p>

<p>
We talk much about education, and yet none will
assume the office of an educator. I never gave any one
the whole advantage of myself. I never afforded him the
culture of my love. How can I talk of charity, who at
last withhold the kindness which alone makes charity
desirable? The poor want nothing less than me myself,
and I shirk charity by giving rags and meat.

Very dangerous is the talent of composition, the
striking out the heart of life at a blow, as the Indian

<p>
I thank God that the cheapness which appears in
time and the world, the trivialness of the whole scheme
of things, is in my own cheap and trivial moment. I am
time and the world. I assert no independence. In me
are summer and winter, village life and commercial
routine, pestilence and famine and refreshing breezes,
joy and sadness, life and death. How near is yesterday!
How far to-morrow! I have seen nails which were
driven before I was born. Why do they look old and
rusty? Why does not God make some mistake to show
to us that time is a delusion? Why did I invent time
but to destroy it?
</p>

<p>
Did you ever remember the moment when you were
not mean?

<p>
I must confess I have felt mean enough when asked
how I was to act on society, what errand I had to mankind.
Undoubtedly I did not feel mean without a reason,
and yet my loitering is not without defense. I would
fain communicate the wealth of my life to men, would
really give them what is most precious in my gift. I
would secrete pearls with the shellfish and lay up honey
with the bees for them. I will sift the sunbeams for the
public good. I know no riches I would keep back. I
have no private good, unless it be my peculiar ability to
serve the public. This is the only individual property.
Each one may thus be innocently rich. I inclose and
foster the pearl till it is grown. I wish to communicate
those parts of my life which I would gladly live again
myself.
</p>

<p>
It is hard to be a good citizen of the world in any
great sense; but if we do render no interest or increase
to mankind out of that talent God gave us, we can at
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_351" name="Page_351" href="#Page_351">351</a></span>
least preserve the principle unimpaired. One would
like to be making large dividends to society out [of] that
deposited capital in us, but he does well for the most part
if he proves a secure investment only, without adding to
the stock.

Cliffs.—Two little hawks have just come out to play,
like butterflies rising one above the other in endless alternation
far below me. They swoop from side to side in
the broad basin of the tree-tops, with wider and wider
surges, as if swung by an invisible pendulum. They
stoop down on this side and scale up on that.
</p>

<p>
Suddenly I look up and see a new bird, probably an
eagle, quite above me, laboring with the wind not more
than forty rods off. It was the largest bird of the falcon
kind I ever saw. I was never so impressed by any flight.
She sailed the air, and fell back from time to time like a
ship on her beam ends, holding her talons up as if ready
for the arrows. I never allowed before for the grotesque
attitudes of our national bird.<a name='FA_372' id='FA_372' href='#FN_372' class='fnanchor'>[372]</a>

See what a life the gods have given us, set round with
pain and pleasure. It is too strange for sorrow; it is too
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_352" name="Page_352" href="#Page_352">352</a></span>
strange for joy. One while it looks as shallow, though as
intricate, as a Cretan labyrinth, and again it is a pathless
depth. I ask for bread incessantly,—that my life
sustain me, as much as meat my body. No man knoweth
in what hour his life may come. Say not that Nature
is trivial, for to-morrow she will be radiant with beauty.
I am as old—as old as the Alleghanies. I was going
to say Wachusett, but it excites a youthful feeling, as
I were but too happy to be so young.
</p>

<p class="p2">
<i>March 28. Monday.</i> How often must one feel, as he
looks back on his past life, that he has gained a talent
but lost a character! My life has got down into my fingers.
My inspiration at length is only so much breath
as I can breathe.
</p>

<p>
Society affects to estimate men by their talents, but
really feels and knows them by their characters. What
a man does, compared with what he is, is but a small
part. To require that our friend possess a certain skill
is not to be satisfied till he is something less than our
friend.
</p>

<p>
Friendship should be a great promise, a perennial
springtime.
</p>

<p>
I can conceive how the life of the gods may be dull
and tame, if it is not disappointed and insatiate.
</p>

<p class="p2">
One may well feel chagrined when he finds he can
do nearly all he can conceive.

<p>
Some books ripple on like a stream, and we feel that
the author is in the full tide of discourse. Plato and
Jamblichus and Pythagoras and Bacon halt beside
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_353" name="Page_353" href="#Page_353">353</a></span>
them. Long, stringy, slimy thoughts which flow or run
together. They read as if written for military men or
men of business, there is such a dispatch in them, and
a double-quick time, a Saratoga march with beat of
drum. But the grave thinkers and philosophers seem
not to have got their swaddling-clothes off; they are
slower than a Roman army on its march, the rear encampment
to-night where the van camped last night.
The wise Jamblichus eddies and gleams like a watery
slough.
</p>

<p>
But the reviewer seizes the pen and shouts, "Forward!
Alamo and Fanning!" and after rolls the tide
of war. Immediately the author discovers himself
launched, and if the slope was easy and the grease good,
does not go to the bottom.
</p>

<p>
They flow as glibly as mill-streams sucking under a
race-way. The flow is ofttimes in the poor reader who
makes such haste over their pages, as to the traveller
the walls and fences seem to travel. But the most rapid
trot is no flow after all.<a name='FA_373' id='FA_373' href='#FN_373' class='fnanchor'>[373]</a>

If I cannot chop wood in the yard, can I not chop
wood in my journal? Can I not give vent to that appetite
so? I wish to relieve myself of superfluous energy.
How poor is the life of the best and wisest! The petty
side will appear at last. Understand once how the best
in society live,—with what routine, with what tedium
and insipidity, with what grimness and defiance, with
what chuckling over an exaggeration of the sunshine.
Altogether, are not the actions of your great man poor,
even pitiful and ludicrous?

I am astonished, I must confess, that man looks so respectable
in nature, considering the littlenesses Socrates
must descend to in the twenty-four hours, that he yet
wears a serene countenance and even adorns nature.

<p class="p2">
<i>March 30. Wednesday.</i> Though Nature's laws are
more immutable than any despot's, yet to our daily
life they rarely seem rigid, but we relax with license in
summer weather. We are not often nor harshly reminded
of the things we may not do. I am often
astonished to see how long, and with what manifold
infringements of the natural laws, some men I meet in
the highway maintain life. She does not deny them
quarter; they do not die without priest. All the while
she rejoices, for if they are not one part of her they are
another. I am convinced that consistency is the secret
of health. How many a poor man, striving to live a pure
life, pines and dies after a life of sickness, and his successors
doubt if Nature is not pitiless; while the confirmed
and consistent sot, who is content with his rank
life like mushrooms, a mass of corruption, still dozes
comfortably under a hedge. He has made his peace
with himself; there is no strife. Nature is really very
kind and liberal to all persons of vicious habits. They
take great licenses with her. She does not exhaust them
with many excesses.<a name='FA_374' id='FA_374' href='#FN_374' class='fnanchor'>[374]</a>

<p class="p2">
How hard it is to be greatly related to mankind!
They are only my uncles and aunts and cousins. I hear
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_355" name="Page_355" href="#Page_355">355</a></span>
of some persons greatly related, but only he is so who
has all mankind for his friend. Our intercourse with
the best grows soon shallow and trivial. They no longer
inspire us. After enthusiasm comes insipidity and
blankness. The sap of all noble schemes drieth up,
and the schemers return again and again in despair to
"common sense and labor." If I could help infuse
some life and heart into society, should I not do a service?
Why will not the gods mix a little of the wine of
nobleness with the air we drink? Let virtue have some
firm foothold in the earth. Where does she dwell? Who
are the salt of the earth? May not Love have some resting-place
on the earth as sure [as] the sunshine on the
rock? The crystals imbedded in the cliff sparkle and
gleam from afar, as if they did certainly enrich our
planet; but where does any virtue permanently sparkle
and gleam? She was sent forth over the waste too soon,
before the earth was prepared for her.
</p>

<p>
Rightfully we are to each other the gate of heaven
and redeemers from sin, but now we overlook these
lowly and narrow ways. We will go over the bald mountain-tops
without going through the valleys.
</p>

<p class="p2">
Men do not after all meet on the ground of their real
acquaintance and actual understanding of one another,
but degrade themselves immediately into the puppets
of convention. They do as if, in given circumstances,
they had agreed to know each other only so well. They
rarely get to that [point] that they inform one another
gratuitously, and use each other like the sea and woods
for what is new and inspiring there.
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_356" name="Page_356" href="#Page_356">356</a></span>
</p>
<p>
The best intercourse and communion they have is in
silence above and behind their speech. We should be
very simple to rely on words. As it is, what we knew
before always interprets a man's words. I cannot easily
remember what any man has said, but how can I forget
what he is to me? We know each other better than
we are aware; we are admitted to startling privacies
with every person we meet, and in some emergency we
shall find how well we knew him. To my solitary and
distant thought my neighbor is shorn of his halo, and is
seen as privately and barely as a star through a glass.

<i>March 31. Thursday.</i> I cannot forget the majesty of
that bird at the Cliff. It was no sloop or smaller craft
hove in sight, but a ship of the line, worthy to struggle
with the elements. It was a great presence, as of the
master of river and forest. His eye would not have
quailed before the owner of the soil; none could challenge
his rights. And then his retreat, sailing so steadily
away, was a kind of advance. How is it that man always
feels like an interloper in nature, as if he had
intruded on the domains of bird and beast?<a name='FA_375' id='FA_375' href='#FN_375' class='fnanchor'>[375]</a>

The really efficient laborer will be found not to crowd
his day with work, but will saunter to his task surrounded
by a wide halo of ease and leisure. There will
be a wide margin for relaxation to his day. He is only
earnest to secure the kernels of time, and does not exaggerate
the value of the husk. Why should the hen set
all day? She can lay but one egg, and besides she will
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_357" name="Page_357" href="#Page_357">357</a></span>

<p class="p2">
Nothing is so rare as sense. Very uncommon sense
is poetry, and has a heroic or sweet music. But in verse,
for the most part, the music now runs before and then
behind the sense, but is never coincident with it. Given
the metre, and one will make music while another makes
sense. But good verse, like a good soldier, will make
its own music, and it will march to the same with one
consent. In most verse there is no inherent music. The
man should not march, but walk like a citizen. It is not
time of war but peace. Boys study the metres to write
Latin verses, but it does not help them to write English.
</p>

<p class="p2">
Lydgate's "Story of Thebes," intended for a Canterbury
Tale, is a specimen of most unprogressive, unmusical
verse. Each line rings the knell of its brother,
as if it were introduced but to dispose of him. No mortal
man could have breathed to that cadence without
long intervals of relaxation; the repetition would have
been fatal to the lungs. No doubt there was much
healthy exercise taken in the meanwhile. He should
forget his rhyme and tell his story, or forget his story
and breathe himself.
</p>

<p>
In Shakespeare and elsewhere the climax may be
somewhere along the line, which runs as varied and
meandering as a country road, but in Lydgate it is nowhere
but in the rhyme. The couplets slope headlong
to their confluence.

Tales is full of good sense and humanity, but is not
transcendent poetry. It is so good that it seems like
faultfinding to esteem it second to any other. For picturesque
description of persons it is without a parallel.
It did not need inspiration, but a cheerful and easy
wit. It is essentially humorous, as no inspired poetry is.
Genius is so serious as to be grave and sublime rather.
Humor takes a narrower vision—however broad and
genial it may be—than enthusiasm. Humor delays and

<i>April 3. Sunday.</i> I can remember when I was more
enriched by a few cheap rays of light falling on the
pond-side than by this broad sunny day. Riches have
wings, indeed. The weight of present woe will express
the sweetness of past experience. When sorrow comes,
how easy it is to remember pleasure! When, in winter,
the bees cannot make new honey, they consume the
old.
</p>

<p>
Experience is in the fingers and head. The heart is
inexperienced.
</p>

<p>
Sorrow singeth the sweetest strain: "The Daughters
of Zion," "The Last Sigh of the Moor."
</p>

<p>
Joy is the nectar of flowers, sorrow the honey of bees.
</p>

<p>
I thank God for sorrow. It is hard to be abused. Is
not He kind still, who lets this south wind blow, this
warm sun shine on me?
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_359" name="Page_359" href="#Page_359">359</a></span>
</p>
<p>
I have just heard the flicker among the oaks on the
hillside ushering in a new dynasty. It is the age and
youth of time. Why did Nature set this lure for sickly
mortals? Eternity could not begin with more security
and momentousness than the spring. The summer's
eternity is reëstablished by this note.<a name='FA_379' id='FA_379' href='#FN_379' class='fnanchor'>[379]</a> All sights and
sounds are seen and heard both in time and eternity.
And when the eternity of any sight or sound strikes the
eye or ear, they are intoxicated with delight.
</p>

<p>
Sometimes, as through a dim haze, we see objects in
their eternal relations; and they stand like Stonehenge
and the Pyramids, and we wonder who set them up
and what for.
</p>

<p>
The destiny of the soul can never be studied by the
reason, for its modes are not ecstatic. In the wisest
calculation or demonstration I but play a game with
myself. I am not to be taken captive by myself.
</p>

<p>
I cannot convince myself. God must convince. I
can calculate a problem in arithmetic, but not any
morality.
</p>

<p>
Virtue is incalculable, as it is inestimable. Well,
man's destiny is but virtue, or manhood. It is wholly
moral, to be learned only by the life of the soul. God
cannot calculate it. He has no moral philosophy, no
ethics. The reason, before it can be applied to such a
subject, will have to fetter and restrict it. How can he,
step by step, perform that long journey who has not
conceived whither he is bound? How can he expect to
perform an arduous journey without interruption who
has no passport to the end?
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_360" name="Page_360" href="#Page_360">360</a></span>
</p>
<p>
On one side of man is the actual, and on the other
the ideal. The former is the province of the reason; it
is even a divine light when directed upon it, but it cannot
reach forward into the ideal without blindness. The
moon was made to rule by night, but the sun to rule by
day. Reason will be but a pale cloud, like the moon,
when one ray of divine light comes to illumine the soul.
</p>

<p>
How rich and lavish must be the system which can
afford to let so many moons burn all the day as well as
the night, though no man stands in need of their light!
There is none of that kind of economy in Nature that
husbands its stock, but she supplies inexhaustible means
to the most frugal methods. The poor may learn of
her frugality, and the rich generosity. Having carefully
determined the extent of her charity, she establishes it
forever; her almsgiving is an annuity. She supplies to
the bee only so much wax as is necessary for its cell, so
that no poverty could stint it more; but the little economist
which fed the Evangelist in the desert still keeps
in advance of the immigrant, and fills the cavities of
the forest for his repast.

<p class="p2">
<i>July 5. Saturday.</i> Walden.—Yesterday I came here
to live. My house makes me think of some mountain
houses I have seen, which seemed to have a fresher
auroral atmosphere about them, as I fancy of the halls
of Olympus. I lodged at the house of a saw-miller last
summer, on the Caatskill Mountains, high up as Pine
Orchard, in the blueberry and raspberry region, where
the quiet and cleanliness and coolness seemed to be all
one,—which had their ambrosial character. He was
the miller of the Kaaterskill Falls. They were a clean
and wholesome family, inside and out, like their house.
The latter was not plastered, only lathed, and the inner
doors were not hung. The house seemed high-placed,
airy, and perfumed, fit to entertain a travelling god.
It was so high, indeed, that all the music, the broken
strains, the waifs and accompaniments of tunes, that
swept over the ridge of the Caatskills, passed through
its aisles. Could not man be man in such an abode?
And would he ever find out this grovelling life?<a name='FA_380' id='FA_380' href='#FN_380' class='fnanchor'>[380]</a> It
was the very light and atmosphere in which the works
of Grecian art were composed, and in which they rest.
They have appropriated to themselves a loftier hall than
mortals ever occupy, at least on a level with the mountain-brows
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_362" name="Page_362" href="#Page_362">362</a></span>
of the world. There was wanting a little
of the glare of the lower vales, and in its place a pure
twilight as became the precincts of heaven. Yet so
equable and calm was the season there that you could
not tell whether it was morning or noon or evening.
Always there was the sound of the morning cricket.
</p>

<p class="p2">
<i>July 6.</i> I wish to meet the facts of life—the vital
facts, which are the phenomena or actuality the gods
meant to show us—face to face, and so I came down
here. Life! who knows what it is, what it does? If I
am not quite right here, I am less wrong than before;
and now let us see what they will have. The preacher,
instead of vexing the ears of drowsy farmers on their day
of rest, at the end of the week,—for Sunday always
seemed to me like a fit conclusion of an ill-spent week
and not the fresh and brave beginning of a new one,—with
this one other draggletail and postponed affair of a
sermon, from thirdly to fifteenthly, should teach them
with a thundering voice pause and simplicity. "Stop!
Avast! Why so fast?"<a name='FA_381' id='FA_381' href='#FN_381' class='fnanchor'>[381]</a> In all studies we go not forward
but rather backward with redoubled pauses. We always
study <i>antiques</i> with silence and reflection. Even time
has a depth, and below its surface the waves do not lapse
and roar. I wonder men can be so frivolous almost
as to attend to the gross form of negro slavery, there
are so many keen and subtle masters who subject us
both. Self-emancipation in the West Indies of a man's
thinking and imagining provinces, which should be
more than his island territory,—one emancipated heart
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_363" name="Page_363" href="#Page_363">363</a></span>
and intellect! It would knock off the fetters from a
million slaves.
</p>

<p class="p2">
<i>July 7.</i> I am glad to remember to-night, as I sit by
my door, that I too am at least a remote descendant of
that heroic race of men of whom there is tradition. I too
sit here on the shore of my Ithaca, a fellow-wanderer
and survivor of Ulysses. How symbolical, significant of
I know not what, the pitch pine stands here before my
door! Unlike any glyph I have seen sculptured or

The Great Spirit makes indifferent all times and

our distractions. But nearest to all things is that power

is not the workman whom we have hired, but ever the

the subjects of an experiment how singular! Can we
not dispense with the society of our gossips a little while
under these circumstances?

Here I know I am in good company; here is the
world, its centre and metropolis, and all the palms of
Asia and the laurels of Greece and the firs of the
Arctic Zone incline thither. Here I can read Homer, if
I would have books, as well as in Ionia, and not wish
myself in Boston, or New York, or London, or Rome, or
Greece. In such place as this he wrote or sang. Who
should come to my lodge just now but a true Homeric
boor, one of those Paphlagonian men? Alek Therien,
he called himself; a Canadian now, a woodchopper, a
post-maker; makes fifty posts—holes them, <i>i. e.</i>—in
a day; and who made his last supper on a woodchuck
which his dog caught. And he too has heard of Homer,
and <i>if it were not for books, would not know what to do</i>
rainy days. Some priest once, who could read glibly

from the Greek itself, taught him reading in a measure—his

withal, thanks to their dear experience. And one

I shall live so myself. Only I should like a wilder country,

coming between the house mouse and the former. Its

There is a memorable interval between the written
and the spoken language, the language read and the
language heard. The one is transient, a sound, a tongue,
a dialect, and all men learn it of their mothers. It is
loquacious, fragmentary,—raw material. The other is
a reserved, select, matured expression, a deliberate word
addressed to the ear of nations and generations. The
one is natural and convenient, the other divine and instructive.
The clouds flit here below, genial, refreshing
with their showers and gratifying with their tints,—alternate
sun and shade, a grosser heaven adapted to our
trivial wants; but above them repose the blue firmament
and the stars. The stars are written words and
stereotyped on the blue parchment of the skies; the
fickle clouds that hide them from our view, which we on
this side need, though heaven does not, these are our
daily colloquies, our vaporous, garrulous breath.
</p>

<p>
Books must be read as deliberately and reservedly as
they were written. The herd of men, the generations
who speak the Greek and Latin, are not entitled by
the accident of birth to read the works of genius, whose
mother tongue speaks everywhere, and is learned by
every child who hears. The army of the Greeks and
Latins are not coæternary, though contemporary, with
Homer and Plato, Virgil and Cicero. In the transition
ages, nations who loudest spoke the Greek and Latin
tongues, whose mother's milk they were, learned not
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_370" name="Page_370" href="#Page_370">370</a></span>
their nobler dialects, but a base and vulgar speech. The
men of the Middle Ages who spoke so glibly the language
of the Roman and, in the Eastern Empire, of the
Athenian mob, prized only a cheap contemporary learning.
The classics of both languages were virtually lost
and forgotten. When, after the several nations of Europe
had acquired in some degree rude and original languages
of their own, sufficient for the arts of life and conversation,
then the few scholars beheld with advantage from
this more distant standpoint the treasures of antiquity,
and a new Latin age commenced, the era of reading.
Those works of genius were then first classical. All those
millions who had spoken Latin and Greek had not read
Latin and Greek. The time had at length arrived for
the written word, the <i>scripture</i>, to be heard. What the
multitude could not <i>hear</i>, after the lapse of centuries a
few scholars <i>read</i>. This is the matured thought which
was not spoken in the market-place, unless it be in a
market-place where the free genius of mankind resorts
to-day. There is something very choice and select in a
written word. No wonder Alexander carried his Homer
in a precious casket on his expeditions. A word which
may be translated into every dialect, and suggests a
truth to every mind, is the most perfect work of human
art; and as it may be breathed and taken on our lips,
and, as it were, become the product of our physical
organs, as its sense is of our intellectual, it is the nearest
to life itself.<a name='FA_394' id='FA_394' href='#FN_394' class='fnanchor'>[394]</a> It is the simplest and purest channel by
which a revelation may be transmitted from age to age.
How it subsists itself whole and undiminished till the
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_371" name="Page_371" href="#Page_371">371</a></span>
intelligent reader is born to decipher it! There are the
tracks of Zoroaster, of Confucius and Moses, indelible
in the sands of the remotest times.
</p>

<p class="p2">
There are no monuments of antiquity comparable
to the classics for interest and importance. It does not
need that the scholar should be an antiquarian, for these
works of art have such an immortality as the works of
nature, and are modern at the same time that they are
ancient, like the sun and stars, and occupy by right no
small share of the present. This palpable beauty is the
treasured wealth of the world and the proper inheritance
of each generation. Books, the oldest and the best,
stand rightfully on the shelves of every cottage. They
have not to plead their cause, but they enlighten their
readers and it is gained. When the illiterate and scornful
rustic earns his imagined leisure and wealth, he
turns inevitably at last—he or his children—to these
still higher and yet inaccessible circles; and even when
his descendant has attained to move in the highest rank
of the wise men of his own age and country, he will still
be sensible only of the imperfection of his culture and the
vanity and inefficiency of his intellectual wealth, if his
genius will not permit him to listen with somewhat of
the equanimity of an equal to the fames of godlike men,
which yet, as it were, form an invisible upper class in
every society.<a name='FA_395' id='FA_395' href='#FN_395' class='fnanchor'>[395]</a>

I have carried an apple in my pocket to-night—a

<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_372" name="Page_372" href="#Page_372">372</a></span>
out, it has got so fine a fragrance that it really
seems like a friendly trick of some pleasant dæmon to
entertain me with.<a name='FA_396' id='FA_396' href='#FN_396' class='fnanchor'>[396]</a> It is redolent of sweet-scented
orchards, of innocent, teeming harvests. I realize the
existence of a goddess Pomona, and that the gods have
really intended that men should feed divinely, like themselves,
on their own nectar and ambrosia. They have
so painted this fruit, and freighted it with such a fragrance,
that it satisfies much more than an animal appetite.
Grapes, peaches, berries, nuts, etc., are likewise
provided for those who will sit at their sideboard. I
have felt, when partaking of this inspiring diet, that
my appetite was an indifferent consideration; that eating
became a sacrament, a method of communion, an
ecstatic exercise, a mingling of bloods, and [a] sitting at
the communion table of the world; and so have not only
quenched my thirst at the spring but the health of the
universe.
</p>

<p>
The indecent haste and grossness with which our food
is swallowed have cast a disgrace on the very act of
eating itself. But I do believe that, if this process were
rightly conducted, its aspect and effects would be
wholly changed, and we should receive our daily life
and health, Antæus-like, with an ecstatic delight, and,
with upright front, an innocent and graceful behavior,
take our strength from day to day. This fragrance of
the apple in my pocket has, I confess, deterred me from
eating of it. I am more effectually fed by it another
way.

It is, indeed, the common notion that this fragrance
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_373" name="Page_373" href="#Page_373">373</a></span>
is the only food of the gods, and inasmuch as we are
partially divine we are compelled to respect it.

After the evening train has gone by and left the world
to silence and to me, the whip-poor-will chants her vespers
for half an hour. And when all is still at night,
the owls take up the strain, like mourning women their
ancient ululu. Their most dismal scream is truly Ben-Jonsonian.
Wise midnight hags! It is no honest and
blunt tu-whit tu-who of the poets, but, without jesting,
a most solemn graveyard ditty,—but the mutual consolations
of suicide lovers remembering the pangs and
the delights of supernal love in the infernal groves. And
yet I love to hear their wailing, their doleful responses,
trilled along the woodside, reminding me sometimes of
music and singing birds, as if it were the dark and tearful
side of music, the regrets and sighs, that would fain
be sung. The spirits, the <i>low</i> spirits and melancholy
forebodings, of fallen spirits who once in human shape
night-walked the earth and did the deeds of darkness,
now expiating with their wailing hymns, threnodiai,
their sins in the very scenery of their transgressions.
They give me a new sense of the vastness and mystery
of that nature which is the common dwelling of us both.

"Oh-o-o-o-o that I never had been bor-or-or-or-orn!"
sighs one on this side of the pond, and circles in the
restlessness of despair to some new perch in the gray
oaks. Then, "That I never had been bor-or-or-or-orn!"
echoes one on the further side, with a tremulous sincerity,
and "Bor-or-or-or-orn" comes faintly from far

and all the rules of their old round tables, but
they have waxed hoarse and solemnly grave and serious
their voices, mocking at mirth, and their wine has lost
its flavor and is only liquor to distend their paunches,
and never comes sweet intoxication to drown the memory
of the past, but mere saturation and water-logged
dullness and distension. Still the most aldermanic, with
his chin upon a pad, which answers for a napkin to his
drooling chaps, under the eastern shore quaffs a deep
draught of the once scorned water, and passes round
the cup with the ejaculation <i>tr-r-r-r-r-oonk, tr-r-r-r-r-oonk,
tr-r-r-r-oonk!</i> and straightway comes over the
water from some distant cove the selfsame password,
where the next in seniority and girth has gulped down
to his mark; and when the strain has made the circuit
of the shores, then ejaculates the master of ceremonies
with satisfaction <i>tr-r-r-r-oonk!</i> and each in turn repeats
the sound, down to the least distended, leakiest, flabbiest

All nature is classic and akin to art. The sumach
and pine and hickory which surround my house remind
me of the most graceful sculpture. Sometimes their tops,
or a single limb or leaf, seems to have grown to a distinct
expression as if it were a symbol for me to interpret.
Poetry, painting, and sculpture claim at once and
associate with themselves those perfect specimens of
the art of nature,—leaves, vines, acorns, pine cones, etc.
The critic must at last stand as mute though contented
before a true poem as before an acorn or a vine leaf.
The perfect work of art is received again into the bosom
of nature whence its material proceeded, and that criticism
which can only detect its unnaturalness has no
longer any office to fulfill. The choicest maxims that
have come down to us are more beautiful or integrally
wise than they are wise to our understandings. This
wisdom which we are inclined to pluck from their stalk
is the point only of a single association. Every natural
form—palm leaves and acorns, oak leaves and sumach
and dodder—are [<i>sic</i>] untranslatable aphorisms.

Twenty-three years since, when I was five years old,
I was brought from Boston to this pond, away in the
country,—which was then but another name for the
extended world for me,—one of the most ancient scenes
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_381" name="Page_381" href="#Page_381">381</a></span>
stamped on the tablets of my memory, the oriental
Asiatic valley of my world, whence so many races and
inventions have gone forth in recent times. That woodland
vision for a long time made the drapery of my
dreams. That sweet solitude my spirit seemed so early
to require that I might have room to entertain my
thronging guests, and that speaking silence that my
ears might distinguish the significant sounds. Somehow
or other it at once gave the preference to this
recess among the pines, where almost sunshine and
shadow were the only inhabitants that varied the scene,
over that tumultuous and varied city, as if it had found
its proper nursery.

<p>
Well, now, to-night my flute awakes the echoes over
this very water, but one generation of pines has fallen,
and with their stumps I have cooked my supper, and
a lusty growth of oaks and pines is rising all around
its brim and preparing its wilder aspect for new infant
eyes. Almost the same johnswort springs from the same
perennial root in this pasture. Even I have at length
helped to clothe that fabulous landscape of my imagination,
and one result of my presence and influence is seen
in these bean leaves and corn blades and potato vines.<a name='FA_406' id='FA_406' href='#FN_406' class='fnanchor'>[406]</a>

<i>Aug. 23. Saturday.</i> I set out this afternoon to go
a-fishing for pickerel to eke out my scanty fare of vegetables.
From Walden I went through the woods to Fair
Haven, but by the way the rain came on again, and my
fates compelled me to stand a half-hour under a pine,
piling boughs over my head, and wearing my pocket
handkerchief for an umbrella; and when at length I had
made one cast over the pickerel-weed, the thunder gan
romblen in the heven with that grisly steven that Chaucer
tells of.<a name='FA_410' id='FA_410' href='#FN_410' class='fnanchor'>[410]</a> (The gods must be proud, with such forked
flashes and such artillery to rout a poor unarmed fisherman.)
I made haste to the nearest hut for a shelter.
This stood a half a mile off the road, and so much the
nearer to the pond. There dwelt a shiftless Irishman,
John Field, and his wife, and many children, from the
broad-faced boy that ran by his father's side to escape
the rain to the wrinkled and sibyl-like, crone-like infant,
not knowing whether to take the part of age or infancy,
that sat upon its father's knee as in the palaces of nobles,
and looked out from its home in the midst of wet and
hunger inquisitively upon the stranger, with the privilege
of infancy; the young creature not knowing but
it might be the last of a line of kings instead of John
Field's poor starveling brat, or, I should rather say, still
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_384" name="Page_384" href="#Page_384">384</a></span>
knowing that it was the last of a noble line and the hope
and cynosure of the world. An honest, hard-working,
but shiftless man plainly was John Field; and his wife,
she too was brave to cook so many succeeding dinners
in the recesses of that lofty stove; with round, greasy
face and bare breast, still thinking to improve her condition
one day; with the never absent mop in hand,
and yet no effects of it visible anywhere. The chickens,
like members of the family, stalked about the room,
too much humanized to roast well. They stood and
looked in my eye or pecked at my shoe. He told me his
story, how hard he worked bogging for a neighbor, at
ten dollars an acre and the use of the land with manure
for one year, and the little broad-faced son worked
cheerfully at his father's side the while, not knowing,
alas! how poor a bargain he had made. Living, John
Field, alas! without arithmetic; failing to live.

<p>
"Do you ever fish?" said I. "Oh yes, I catch a mess
when I am lying by; good perch I catch." "What's
your bait?" "I catch shiners with fishworms, and bait
the perch with them." "You'd better go now, John,"
said his wife, with glistening, hopeful face. But poor
John Field disturbed but a couple of fins, while I was
catching a fair string, and he said it was his luck; and
when he changed seats luck changed seats too. Thinking
to live by some derivative old-country mode in this
primitive new country, <i>e. g.</i> to catch perch with shiners.<a name='FA_411' id='FA_411' href='#FN_411' class='fnanchor'>[411]</a>

Why not live a hard and emphatic life, not to be

dispersed, and I see in what field I stand.

<p>
When on my way this afternoon, Shall I go down
this long hill in the rain to fish in the pond? I ask myself.
And I say to myself: Yes, roam far, grasp life and
conquer it, learn much and live. Your fetters are
knocked off; you are really free. Stay till late in the
night; be unwise and daring. See many men far and
near, in their fields and cottages before the sun sets,
though as if many more were to be seen. And yet each
<i>rencontre</i> shall be so satisfactory and simple that no other
shall seem possible. Do not repose every night as villagers
do. The noble life is continuous and unintermitting.
At least, live with a longer radius. Men come
home at night only from the next field or street, where
their household echoes haunt, and their life pines and is
sickly because it breathes its own breath. Their shadows
morning and evening reach farther than their daily steps.
But come home from far, from ventures and perils,
from enterprise and discovery and crusading, with faith
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_386" name="Page_386" href="#Page_386">386</a></span>
and experience and character.<a name='FA_413' id='FA_413' href='#FN_413' class='fnanchor'>[413]</a> Do not rest much. Dismiss
prudence, fear, conformity. Remember only what
is promised. Make the day light you, and the night
hold a candle, though you be falling from heaven to
earth "from morn to dewy eve a summer's day."

Though the race is not so degenerated but a man
might possibly live in a cave to-day and keep himself
warm by furs, yet, as caves and wild beasts are not
plenty enough to accommodate all at the present day,
it were certainly better to accept the advantages which
the invention and industry of mankind offer. In thickly
settled civilized communities, boards and shingles, lime
and brick, are cheaper and more easily come by than
suitable caves, or the whole logs, or bark in sufficient
quantity, or even well-tempered clay or flat stones.<a name='FA_415' id='FA_415' href='#FN_415' class='fnanchor'>[415]</a> A
tolerable house for a rude and hardy race that lived
much out of doors was once made here without any of
these last materials. According to the testimony of the
first settlers of Boston, an Indian wigwam was as comfortable
in winter as an English house with all its wainscotting,
and they had advanced so far as to regulate
the effect of the wind by a mat suspended over the hole
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_388" name="Page_388" href="#Page_388">388</a></span>
in the roof, which was moved by a string. Such a lodge
was, in the first instance, constructed in a day or two
and taken down and put up again in a few hours, and
every family had one.<a name='FA_416' id='FA_416' href='#FN_416' class='fnanchor'>[416]</a>
</p>

<p class="p2">
Thus, to try our civilization by a fair test, in the
ruder states of society every family owns a shelter as
good as the best, and sufficient for its ruder and simpler
wants; but in modern civilized society, though the birds
of the air have their nests, and woodchucks and foxes
their holes, though each one is commonly the owner of
his coat and hat though never so poor, yet not more
than one man in a thousand owns a shelter, but the
nine hundred and ninety-nine pay an annual tax for
this outside garment of all, indispensable summer and
winter, which would buy a village of Indian wigwams
and contributes to keep them poor as long as they live.
But, answers one, by simply paying this annual tax the
poorest man secures an abode which is a palace compared
to the Indian's. An annual rent of from twenty
to sixty or seventy dollars entitles him to the benefit
of all the improvements of centuries,—Rumford fireplace,
back plastering, Venetian blinds, copper pump,
spring lock, etc., etc.<a name='FA_417' id='FA_417' href='#FN_417' class='fnanchor'>[417]</a> But while civilization has been
improving our houses, she has not equally improved
the men who should occupy them. She has created
palaces, but it was not so easy to create noblemen and
kings. The mason who finishes the cornice of the palace
returns at night, perchance, to a hut no better than a
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_389" name="Page_389" href="#Page_389">389</a></span>
wigwam.<a name='FA_418' id='FA_418' href='#FN_418' class='fnanchor'>[418]</a> If she claims to have made a real advance
in the welfare of man, she must show how she has
produced better dwellings without making them more
costly. And the cost of a thing, it will be remembered,
is the amount of life it requires to be exchanged for it,
immediately or in the long run. An average house costs
perhaps from one thousand to fifteen hundred dollars,
and to earn this sum will require from fifteen to twenty
years of the day laborer's life, even if he is not incumbered
with a family; so that he must spend more than
half his life before a wigwam can be earned; and if we
suppose he pays a rent instead, this is but a doubtful
choice of evils. Would the savage have been wise to
exchange his wigwam for a palace on these terms?<a name='FA_419' id='FA_419' href='#FN_419' class='fnanchor'>[419]</a>

When I consider my neighbors, the farmers of Concord,

half of that toil to the cost of their houses; and commonly
they have not yet paid for them.<a name='FA_420' id='FA_420' href='#FN_420' class='fnanchor'>[420]</a> This is the

It reflects no little dignity on Nature, the fact that
the Romans once inhabited her,—that from this same
unaltered hill, forsooth, the Roman once looked out
upon the sea, as from a signal station. The vestiges of
military roads, of houses and tessellated courts and
baths,—Nature need not be ashamed of these relics of
her children. The hero's cairn,—one doubts at length
whether his relations or Nature herself raised the hill.
The whole earth is but a hero's cairn. How often are
the Romans flattered by the historian and antiquary!
Their vessels penetrated into this frith and up that
river of some remote isle. Their military monuments
still remain on the hills and under the sod of the valleys.
The oft-repeated Roman story is written in still legible
characters in every quarter of the old world, and but to-day

confirms their fame. Some "Judæa Capta," with a woman

Some make the mythology of the Greeks to have
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_391" name="Page_391" href="#Page_391">391</a></span>
been borrowed from that of the Hebrews, which however
is not to be proved by analogies,—the story of
Jupiter dethroning his father Saturn, for instance, from
the conduct of Cham towards his father Noah, and the
division of the world among the three brothers. But
the Hebrew fable will not bear to be compared with the
Grecian. The latter is infinitely more sublime and
divine. The one is a history of mortals, the other a
history of gods and heroes, therefore not so ancient. The
one god of the Hebrews is not so much of a gentleman,
not so gracious and divine, not so flexible and catholic,
does not exert so intimate an influence on nature as
many a one of the Greeks. He is not less human, though
more absolute and unapproachable. The Grecian were
youthful and living gods, but still of godlike or divine
race, and had the virtues of gods. The Hebrew had not
all of the divinity that is in man, no real love for man,
but an inflexible justice. The attribute of the one god
has been infinite power, not grace, not humanity, nor
love even,—wholly masculine, with no sister Juno, no
Apollo, no Venus in him. I might say that the one god

comments, "In this world we must not look for Justice;
when we are stript of all, then shall we have it. For
here something will be found about us that shall corrupt

They all provoked or challenged the gods,—Amphion,
Apollo and Diana, and was killed by them;
Thamyris, the Muses, who conquered him in music,
took away his eyesight and melodious voice, and broke
his lyre. Marsyas took up the flute which Minerva
threw away, challenged Apollo, was flayed alive by him,
and his death mourned by Fauns, Satyrs, and Dryads,
whose tears produced the river which bears his name.

The fable which is truly and naturally composed, so

When we read that Bacchus made the Tyrrhenian
mariners mad, so that they leaped into the sea, mistaking
it for "a meadow full of flowers," and so became
dolphins, we are not concerned about the historical
truth of this, but rather a higher, poetical truth. We
seem to hear the music of a thought, and care not if
our intellect be not gratified.<a name='FA_428' id='FA_428' href='#FN_428' class='fnanchor'>[428]</a>

original hues, like the fragments of clouds tinted by the

departed sun, the wreck of poems, a retrospect as [of]
the loftiest fames,—what survives of oldest fame,—some
fragment will still float into the latest summer
day and ally this hour to the morning of creation. These
are the materials and hints for a history of the rise and
progress of the race. How from the condition of ants
it arrived at the condition of men, how arts were invented
gradually,—let a thousand surmises shed some
light on this story. We will not be confined by historical,
even geological, periods, which would allow us to doubt
of a progress in human events. If we rise above this
wisdom for the day, we shall expect that this morning
of the race, in which they have been supplied with the
simplest necessaries,—with corn and wine and honey
and oil and fire and articulate speech and agricultural
and other arts,—reared up by degrees from the condition
of ants to men, will be succeeded by a day of equally
progressive splendor; that, in the lapse of the divine
periods, other divine agents and godlike men will assist
to elevate the race as much above its present condition.

It is generally admitted that some of you are poor,
find it hard to get a living, haven't always something in
your pockets, haven't paid for all the dinners you've
actually eaten, or all your coats and shoes, some of
which are already worn out. All this is very well known
to all by hearsay and by experience. It is very evident
what a mean and sneaking life you live, always in the
hampers, always on the limits, trying to get into business
and trying to get out of debt, a very ancient slough,
called by the Latins <i>aes alienum</i>, another's brass,—some
of their coins being made of brass,—and still so
many living and dying and buried to-day by another's
brass; always promising to pay, promising to pay, with
interest, to-morrow perhaps, and die to-day, insolvent;
seeking to curry favor, to get custom, lying, flattering,

There is a civilization going on among brutes as well
as men. Foxes are forest dogs. I hear one barking
raggedly, wildly, demoniacally in the darkness to-night,
seeking expression, laboring with some anxiety, striving
to be a dog outright that he may carelessly run in the
street, struggling for light. He is but a faint man, before
pygmies; an imperfect, burrowing man. He has come
up near to my window, attracted by the light, and barked
a vulpine curse at me, then retreated.<a name='FA_434' id='FA_434' href='#FN_434' class='fnanchor'>[434]</a>

Reading suggested by Hallam's History of Literature.
</p>

<p>
1. "Abelard and Heloise."
</p>

<p>
2. Look at Luigi Pulci. His "Morgante Maggiore,"
published in 1481, "was to the poetical romances of
chivalry what Don Quixote was to their brethren in
prose."
</p>

<p>
3. Leonardo da Vinci. The most remarkable of his
writings still in manuscript. For his universality of
genius, "the first name of the fifteenth century."
</p>

<p>
4. Read Boiardo's "Orlando Innamorato," published
between 1491 and 1500, for its influence on
Ariosto and its intrinsic merits. Its sounding names
repeated by Milton in "Paradise Regained."

It is worth the while to have lived a primitive wilderness
life at some time, to know what are, after all, the
necessaries of life and what methods society has taken
to supply them. I have looked over the old day-books
of the merchants with the same view,—to see what it
was shopmen bought. They are the grossest groceries.<a name='FA_436' id='FA_436' href='#FN_436' class='fnanchor'>[436]</a>
Salt is perhaps the most important article in such a list,
and most commonly bought at the stores, of articles
commonly thought to be necessaries,—salt, sugar,
molasses, cloth, etc.,—by the farmer. You will see why
stores or shops exist, not to furnish tea and coffee, but
salt, etc. Here's the rub, then.
</p>

<p>
I see how I could supply myself with every other
article which I need, without using the shops, and to
obtain this might be the fit occasion for a visit to the
seashore. Yet even salt cannot strictly speaking be
called a necessary of human life, since many tribes do
not use it.

<i>March 26, 1846.</i> The change from foul weather to
fair, from dark, sluggish hours to serene, elastic ones,
is a memorable crisis which all things proclaim. The
change from foulness to serenity is instantaneous. Suddenly
an influx of light, though it was late, filled my
room. I looked out and saw that the pond was already
calm and full of hope as on a summer evening, though
the ice was dissolved but yesterday. There seemed to
be some intelligence in the pond which responded to the
unseen serenity in a distant horizon. I heard a robin
in the distance,—the first I had heard this spring,—repeating
the assurance. The green pitch [pine] suddenly
looked brighter and more erect, as if now entirely
washed and cleansed by the rain. I knew it would not
rain any more. A serene summer-evening sky seemed
darkly reflected in the pond, though the clear sky was
nowhere visible overhead. It was no longer the end of
a season, but the beginning. The pines and shrub
oaks, which had before drooped and cowered the winter
through with myself, now recovered their several characters
and in the landscape revived the expression of an
immortal beauty. Trees seemed all at once to be fitly
grouped, to sustain new relations to men and to one
another. There was somewhat cosmical in the arrangement
of nature. O the evening robin, at the close of
a New England day! If I could ever find the twig he
sits upon! Where does the minstrel really roost? We
perceive it is not the bird of the ornithologist that is
heard,—the <i>Turdus migratorius</i>.
</p>

<p>
The signs of fair weather are seen in the bosom of
ponds before they are recognized in the heavens. It
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_401" name="Page_401" href="#Page_401">401</a></span>
is easy to tell by looking at any twig of the forest whether
its winter is past or not.<a name='FA_440' id='FA_440' href='#FN_440' class='fnanchor'>[440]</a>

<p>
We forget how the sun looks on our fields, as on the
forests and the prairies, as they reflect or absorb his
rays. It matters not whether we stand in Italy or on the
prairies of the West, in the eye of the sun the earth is all
equally cultivated like a garden, and yields to the wave
of an irresistible civilization.
</p>

<p>
This broad field, which I have looked on so long,
looks not to me as the farmer, looks away from me to
the sun, and attends to the harmony of nature. These
beans have results which are not harvested in the
autumn of the year. They do not mind, if I harvest
them, who waters and makes them grow? Our grain-fields
make part of a beautiful picture which the sun
beholds in his daily course, and it matters little comparatively
whether they fill the barns of the husbandman.
The true husbandman will cease from anxiety
and labor with every day, and relinquish all claim to the
produce of his fields.<a name='FA_441' id='FA_441' href='#FN_441' class='fnanchor'>[441]</a>

The avaricious man would fain plant by himself.

A flock of geese has just got in late, now in the dark
flying low over the pond. They came on, indulging at
last like weary travellers in complaint and consolation,
or like some creaking evening mail late lumbering in
with regular anserine clangor. I stood at my door and
could hear their wings when they suddenly spied my
light and, ceasing their noise, wheeled to the east and
apparently settled in the pond.<a name='FA_442' id='FA_442' href='#FN_442' class='fnanchor'>[442]</a>

<i>March 27.</i> This morning I saw the geese from the
door through the mist sailing about in the middle of
the pond, but when I went to the shore they rose and
circled round like ducks over my head, so that I counted
them,—twenty-nine. I after saw thirteen ducks.<a name='FA_443' id='FA_443' href='#FN_443' class='fnanchor'>[443]</a>

To live to a good old age such as the ancients reached,
serene and contented, dignifying the life of man, leading
a simple, epic country life in these days of confusion
and turmoil,—that is what Wordsworth has done.
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_408" name="Page_408" href="#Page_408">408</a></span>
Retaining the tastes and the innocence of his youth.
There is more wonderful talent, but nothing so cheering
and world-famous as this.
</p>

<p>
The life of man would seem to be going all to wrack
and pieces, and no instance of permanence and the ancient
natural health, notwithstanding Burns, and Coleridge,
and Carlyle. It will not do for men to die young;
the greatest genius does not die young. Whom the gods
love most do indeed die young, but not till their life is matured,
and their years are like those of the oak, for they
are the products half of nature and half of God. What
should nature do without old men, not children but men?
</p>

<p>
The life of men, not to become a mockery and a jest,

All dramas have but one scene. There is but one
stage for the peasant and for the actor, and both on the
farm and in the theatre the curtain rises to reveal the
same majestic scenery. The globe of earth is poised in
space for his stage under the foundations of the theatre,
and the cope of heaven, out of reach of the scene-shifter,
overarches it. It is always to be remembered by the
critic that all actions are to be regarded at last as performed
from a distance upon some rood of earth and
amid the operations of nature.

Exaggeration! was ever any virtue attributed to a
man without exaggeration? was ever any vice, without
infinite exaggeration? Do we not exaggerate ourselves
to ourselves, or do we often recognize ourselves for the
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_412" name="Page_412" href="#Page_412">412</a></span>
actual men we are? The lightning is an exaggeration of
light. We live by exaggeration. Exaggerated history
is poetry, and is truth referred to a new standard. To
a small man every greater one is an exaggeration. No
truth was ever expressed but with this sort of emphasis,
so that for the time there was no other truth. The value
of what is really valuable can never be exaggerated.
You must speak loud to those who are hard of hearing;
so you acquire a habit of speaking loud to those who
are not. In order to appreciate any, even the humblest,
man, you must not only understand, but you must first
love him; and there never was such an exaggerator as
love. Who are we? Are we not all of us great men?
And yet what [are] we actually? Nothing, certainly,
to speak of. By an immense exaggeration we appreciate
our Greek poetry and philosophy, Egyptian ruins,
our Shakespeares and Miltons, our liberty and Christianity.
We give importance to this hour over all other
hours. We do not live by justice, but [by grace.]<a name='FA_445' id='FA_445' href='#FN_445' class='fnanchor'>[445]</a>

Carlyle told R. W. E. that he first discovered that he

Youth wants something to look up to, to look forward
to; as the little boy who inquired of me the other day,
"How long do those old-agers live?" and expressed
the intention of compassing two hundred summers at
least. The old man who cobbles shoes without glasses
at a hundred, and cuts a handsome swath at a hundred
and five, is indispensable to give dignity and respectability

From all points of the compass, from the earth beneath
and the heavens above, have come these inspirations
and been entered duly in the order of their arrival
in the journal. Thereafter, when the time arrived, they
were winnowed into lectures, and again, in due time,
from lectures into essays. And at last they stand, like
the cubes of Pythagoras, firmly on either basis; like
statues on their pedestals, but the statues rarely take
hold of hands. There is only such connection and series

Carlyle, we should say, more conspicuously than
any other, though with little enough expressed or even

In him the universal plaint is most settled and serious.

I had one neighbor within half a mile for a short time
when I first went to the woods, Hugh Quoil, an Irishman
who had been a soldier at Waterloo, Colonel Quoil,
as he was called,—I believe that he had killed a colonel
and ridden off his horse,—who lived from hand—sometimes
to mouth,—though it was commonly a glass
of rum that the hand carried. He and his wife awaited
their fate together in an old ruin in Walden woods.
What life he got—or what means of death—he got
by ditching.
</p>

<p>
I never was much acquainted with Hugh Quoil,
though sometimes I met him in the path, and now do
believe that a solid shank-bone, and skull which no
longer aches, lie somewhere, and can still be produced,
which once with garment of flesh and broadcloth were
called and hired to do work as Hugh Quoil. He was a
man of manners and gentlemanlike, as one who had
seen the world, and was capable of more civil speech
than you could well attend to. At a distance he had
seemingly a ruddy face as of biting January, but nearer
at hand it was bright carmine. It would have burnt
your finger to touch his cheek. He wore a straight-bodied
snuff-colored coat which had long been familiar
with him, and carried a turf-knife in his hand—instead
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_415" name="Page_415" href="#Page_415">415</a></span>
of a sword. He had fought on the English side
before, but he fought on the Napoleon side now. Napoleon
went to St. Helena; Hugh Quoil came to Walden
Pond. I heard that he used to tell travellers who inquired
about myself that —— and Thoreau owned the
<i>farm</i> together, but Thoreau lived on the <i>place</i> and carried
it on.<a name='FA_447' id='FA_447' href='#FN_447' class='fnanchor'>[447]</a>
</p>

<p>
He was thirstier than I, and drank more, probably,
but not out of the pond. That was never the lower for
him. Perhaps I ate more than he. The last time I met
him, the only time I spoke with him, was at the foot of
the hill on the highway as I was crossing to the spring
one summer afternoon, the pond water being too warm
for me. I was crossing the road with a pail in my hand,
when Quoil came down the hill, wearing his snuff-colored
coat, as if it were winter, and shaking with
delirium-tremens. I hailed him and told him that my errand
was to get water at a spring close by, only at the foot of
the hill over the fence. He answered, with stuttering
and parched lips, bloodshot eye, and staggering gesture,
he'd like to see it. "Follow me there, then." But I had
got my pail full and back before he scaled the fence.
And he, drawing his coat about him, to warm him, or to
cool him, answered in delirium-tremens, hydrophobia
dialect, which is not easy to be written here, he'd heard
of it, but had never seen it; and so shivered his way
along to town,—to liquor and to oblivion.
</p>

<p>
On Sundays, brother Irishmen and others, who had
gone far astray from steady habits and the village,
crossed my bean-field with empty jugs toward Quoil's.
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_416" name="Page_416" href="#Page_416">416</a></span>
But what for? Did they sell rum there? I asked. "Respectable
people they," "Know no harm of them,"
"Never heard that they drank too much," was the answer
of all wayfarers. They went by sober, stealthy,
silent, skulking (no harm to get elm bark Sundays);
returned loquacious, sociable, having long intended to
call on you.
</p>

<p>
At length one afternoon Hugh Quoil, feeling better,
perchance, with snuff-colored coat, as usual, paced
solitary and soldier-like, thinking [of] Waterloo, along
the woodland road to the foot of the hill by the spring;
and there the Fates met him, and threw him down in his
snuff-colored coat on the gravel, and got ready to cut
his thread; but not till travellers passed, who would
raise him up, get him perpendicular, then settle, settle
quick; but legs, what are they? "Lay me down," says
Hugh hoarsely. "House locked up—key—in pocket—wife
in town." And the Fates cut, and there he lay
by the wayside, five feet ten, and looking taller than in
life.
</p>

<p>
He has gone away; his house here "all tore to pieces."
What kind of fighting or ditching work he finds to
do now, how it fares with him, whether his thirst is
quenched, whether there is still some semblance of that
carmine cheek, struggles still with some liquid demon—perchance
on more equal terms—till he swallow him
completely, I cannot by any means learn. What his
salutation is now, what his January-morning face, what
he thinks of Waterloo, what start he has gained or lost,
what work still for the ditcher and forester and soldier
now, there is no evidence. He was here, the likes of him,
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_417" name="Page_417" href="#Page_417">417</a></span>
for a season, standing light in his shoes like a faded gentleman,
with gesture almost learned in drawing-rooms;
wore clothes, hat, shoes, cut ditches, felled wood, did
farm work for various people, kindled fires, worked
enough, ate enough, drank too much. He was one of
those unnamed, countless sects of philosophers who
founded no school.
</p>

<p>
Now that he was gone, and his wife was gone too,—for
she could not support the solitude,—before it was
too late and the house was torn down, I went over to
make a call. Now that Irishmen with jugs avoided the
old house, I visited it,—an "unlucky castle now," said
they. There lay his old clothes curled up by habit, as if
it were himself, upon his raised plank bed. His pipe lay
broken on the hearth; and scattered about were soiled
cards—king of diamonds, hearts, spades—on the floor.
One black chicken, which they could not catch, still went
to roost in the next apartment, stepping silent over the
floor, frightened by the sound of its own wings, black
as night and as silent, too, not even croaking; awaiting
Reynard, its god actually dead. There was the dim outline
of a garden which had been planted, but had never
received its first hoeing, now overrun with weeds, with
burs and cockles, which stick to your clothes; as if in
the spring he had contemplated a harvest of corn and
beans before that strange trembling of the limbs overtook
him. Skin of woodchuck fresh-stretched, never to be
cured, met once in bean-field by the Waterloo man with
uplifted hoe; no cap, no mittens wanted. Pipe on hearth
no more to be lighted, best buried with him.<a name='FA_448' id='FA_448' href='#FN_448' class='fnanchor'>[448]</a>

In case of an embargo there will be found to be old
clothes enough in everybody's garret to last till the
millennium. We are fond of news, novelties, new things.
The bank-bill that is torn in two will pass if you save
the pieces, if you have only got the essential piece with
the signatures. Lowell and Manchester and Fall River
think you will let go their broadcloth currency when it is
torn; but hold on, have an eye to the signature about
the back of it, and endorse the man's name from whom
you received it, and they will be the first to fail and find
nothing at all in their garrets. Every day our garments
become more assimilated to the man that wears them,
more near and dear to us, and not finally to be laid aside
but with such delay and medical appliance and solemnity
as our other mortal coil.<a name='FA_449' id='FA_449' href='#FN_449' class='fnanchor'>[449]</a> We know, after all,

King James loved his old shoes best. Who does not?
Indeed these new clothes are often won and worn only
after a most painful birth. At first movable prisons,
oyster-shells which the tide only raises, opens, and
shuts, washing in what scanty nutriment may be afloat.
How many men walk over the limits, carrying their
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_419" name="Page_419" href="#Page_419">419</a></span>
limits with them? In the stocks they stand, not without
gaze of multitudes, only without rotten eggs, in torturing
boots, the last wedge but one driven. Why should
we be startled at death? Life is constant putting off
of the mortal coil,—coat, cuticle, flesh and bones, all
old clothes.

A man who has at length found out something important
to do will not have to get a new suit to do it in.
For him the old will do, lying dusty in the garret for an
indefinite period. Old shoes will serve a hero longer
than they have served his valet. Bare feet are the oldest
of shoes, and he can make them do. Only they who go
to legislature and soirées,—they must have new coats,
coats to turn as often as the man turns in them. Who
ever saw his old shoes, his old coat, actually worn out,
returned to their original elements, so that it was not

the last vestige else is gone, unfolding still its early sweet-scented
blossoms in the spring, to be plucked only by the
musing traveller; planted, tended, weeded [?], watered
by children's hands in front-yard plot,—now by wall-side
in retired pasture, or giving place to a new rising
forest. The last of that stirp, sole survivor of that family.
Little did the dark children think that that weak slip
with its two eyes which they watered would root itself
so, and outlive them, and house in the rear that shaded

You still hear from time to time the whinnering of
the raccoon, still living as of old in hollow trees, washing
its food before it eats it. The red fox barks at night.
The loon comes in the fall to sail and bathe in the pond,
making the woods ring with its wild laughter in the early
morning, at rumor of whose arrival all Concord sportsmen
are on the alert, in gigs, on foot, two by two, three
[by three], with patent rifles, patches, conical balls, spy-glass
or open hole over the barrel. They seem already
to hear the loon laugh; come rustling through the woods
like October leaves, these on this side, those on that,
for the poor loon cannot be omnipresent; if he dive
here, must come up somewhere. The October wind
rises, rustling the leaves, ruffling the pond water, so that
no loon can be seen rippling the surface. Our sportsmen
scour, sweep the pond with spy-glass in vain, making
the woods ring with rude [?] charges of powder, for the
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_422" name="Page_422" href="#Page_422">422</a></span>
loon went off in that morning rain with one loud, long,

Or in the gray dawn the sleeper hears the long ducking
gun explode over toward Goose Pond, and, hastening
to the door, sees the remnant of a flock, black duck
or teal, go whistling by with outstretched neck, with
broken ranks, but in ranger order. And the silent hunter
emerges into the carriage road with ruffled feathers at
his belt, from the dark pond-side where he has lain in
his bower since the stars went out.

advantages, no water privilege, only the deep Walden
Pond and cool Brister's Spring,—privileges to drink

What seems so fair and poetic in antiquity—almost

One wonders how so much, after all, was expressed in
the old way, so much here depends upon the emphasis,
tone, pronunciation, style, and spirit of the reading.
No writer uses so profusely all the aids to intelligibility
which the printer's art affords. You wonder
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_426" name="Page_426" href="#Page_426">426</a></span>
how others had contrived to write so many pages without
emphatic, italicized words, they are so expressive,
so natural and indispensable, here. As if none had ever
used the demonstrative pronoun demonstratively. In
another's sentences the thought, though immortal, is,
as it were, embalmed and does not <i>strike</i> you, but here
it is so freshly living, not purified by the ordeal of death,
that it stirs in the very extremities, the smallest particles
and pronouns are all alive with it.—You must not
say it, but <i>it</i>. It is not simple it, your it or mine, but <i>it</i>.

What are the men of New England about? I have
travelled some in New England, especially in Concord,
and I found that no enterprise was on foot which it
would not disgrace a man to take part in. They seemed
to be employed everywhere in shops and offices and
fields. They seemed, like the Brahmins of the East, to
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_427" name="Page_427" href="#Page_427">427</a></span>
be doing penance in a thousand curious, unheard-of
ways, their endurance surpassing anything I had ever
seen or heard of,—Simeon Stylites, Brahmins looking
in the face of the sun, standing on one leg, dwelling at
the roots of trees, nothing to it; any of the twelve labors
of Hercules to be matched,—the Nemean lion, Lernæan
hydra, Œnœan stag, Erymanthian boar, Augean
stables, Stymphalian birds, Cretan bull, Diomedes'
mares, Amazonian girdle, monster Geryon, Hesperian
apples, three-headed Cerberus, nothing at all in comparison,
being only twelve and having an end. For I
could never see that these men ever slew or captured
any of their monsters, or finished any of their labors.
They have no "friend Iolaus to burn, with a hot iron, the
root" of the hydra's head; for as soon as one head is
crushed, two spring up.<a name='FA_471' id='FA_471' href='#FN_471' class='fnanchor'>[471]</a>

It is hard to have a Southern overseer; it is worse to
have a Northern one; but worst of all when you are
yourself the slave-driver. Look at the lonely teamster
on the highway, wending to market by day or night; is
he a son of the morning, with somewhat of divinity in
him, fearless because immortal, going to receive his
birthright, greeting the sun as his fellow, bounding with
youthful, gigantic strength over his mother earth? See
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_428" name="Page_428" href="#Page_428">428</a></span>
how he cowers and sneaks, how vaguely, indefinitely all
the day he fears, not being immortal, not divine, the
slave and prisoner of his own opinion of himself, fame
which he has earned by his own deeds. Public opinion
is a weak tyrant compared with private opinion. What

I see young men, my equals, who have inherited from
their spiritual father a soul,—broad, fertile, uncultivated,—from
their earthly father a farm,—with cattle
and barns and farming tools, the implements of the
picklock and the counterfeiter. Better if they had been
born in the open pasture and suckled by a wolf, or perhaps
cradled in a manger, that they might have seen
with clear eye what was the field they were called to
labor in. The young man has got to live a man's life,
then, in this world, pushing all these things before him,
and get on as well as he can. How many a poor immortal
soul I have met, well-nigh crushed and smothered,
creeping slowly down the road of life, pushing before it
a barn seventy-five by forty feet and one hundred acres
of land,—tillage, pasture, wood-lot! This dull, opaque
garment of the flesh is load enough for the strongest
spirit, but with such an earthly garment superadded
the spiritual life is soon plowed into the soil for compost.

Bread I made pretty well for awhile, while I remembered
the rules; for I studied this out methodically,
going clear back to the primitive days and first invention
of the unleavened kind, and coming gradually
down through that lucky accidental souring of the
dough which taught men the leavening process, and
all the various fermentations thereafter, till you get to
"good, sweet, wholesome bread," the staff of life. I
went on very well, mixing rye and flour and Indian and
potato with success, till one morning I had forgotten the
rules, and thereafter scalded the yeast,—killed it out,—and
so, after the lapse of a month, was glad after all

affections and intellect equally developed. Has advanced
farther, and a new heaven opens to him. Love
and Friendship, Religion, Poetry, the Holy are familiar
to him. The life of an Artist; more variegated, more
observing, finer perception; not so robust, elastic; practical
enough in his own field; faithful, a judge of men.
There is no such general critic of men and things, no
such trustworthy and faithful man. More of the divine
realized in him than in any. A poetic critic, reserving

realize an entire life; a catholic observer; habitually
takes in the farthest star and nebula into his scheme.
Will be the last man to be disappointed as the ages revolve.
His attitude is one of greater faith and expectation

three paces from me, at first trembling with fear, yet
unwilling to move; a poor, wee thing, lean and bony,
with ragged ears and sharp nose, scant tail and slender
paws. It looked as if nature no longer contained the
breed of nobler bloods, the earth stood on its last legs.
Is nature, too, unsound at last? I took two steps, and
lo, away he scud with elastic spring over the snowy
crust into the bushes, a free creature of the forest,
still wild and fleet; and such then was his nature, and
his motion asserted its vigor and dignity. Its large eye
looked at first young and diseased, almost dropsical,
unhealthy. But it bound[ed] free, the venison, straightening

How many an afternoon has been stolen from more
profitable, if not more attractive, industry,—afternoons
when a good run of custom might have been expected
on the main street, such as tempt the ladies out a-shopping,—spent,
I say, by me away in the meadows, in
the well-nigh hopeless attempt to set the river on fire
or be set on fire by it, with such tinder as I had, with
such flint as I was. Trying at least to make it flow with
milk and honey, as I had heard of, or liquid gold, and
drown myself without getting wet,—a laudable enterprise,
though I have not much to show for it.

So many autumn days spent outside the town, trying
to hear what was in the wind, to hear it and carry it
express. I well-nigh sunk all my capital in it, and lost
my own breath into the bargain, by running in the face
of it. Depend upon it, if it had concerned either of
the parties, it would have appeared in the yeoman's
gazette, the <i>Freeman</i>, with other earliest intelligence.

Surveyor, if not of higher ways, then of forest paths
and all across-lot routes, keeping many open ravines
bridged and passable at all seasons, where the public

only without charge, but even at considerable risk and
inconvenience. Many a mower would have forborne to
complain had he been aware of the invisible public
good that was in jeopardy.

faithfully minding my business without a partner, till
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_435" name="Page_435" href="#Page_435">435</a></span>

would not, after all, admit me into the list of town
officers, nor make the place a sinecure with moderate
allowance.
</p>

<p>
I have looked after the wild stock of the town, which
pastures in common, and every one knows that these
cattle give you a good deal of trouble in the way of
leaping fences. I have counted and registered all the
eggs I could find at least, and have had an eye to all
nooks and corners of the farm, though I didn't always
know whether Jonas or Solomon worked in a particular
field to-day; that was none of my business. I only
knew him for one of the men, and trusted that he was
as well employed as I was. I had to make my daily
entries in the general farm book, and my duties may
sometimes have made me a little stubborn and unyielding.

Many a day spent on the hilltops waiting for the
sky to fall, that I might catch something, though I
never caught much, only a little, manna-wise, that
would dissolve again in the sun.

wheels against emergencies, but, with the bulky cargo
which we stevedores had stowed in it, it proved but an
indifferent land carriage. For water and water-casks
there was a plentiful supply of muskmelons from our
patch, which had just begun to be ripe, and chests and
spare spars and sails and tent and guns and munitions
for the galleon. And as we pushed it through the
meadows to the river's bank, we stepped as lightly about
it as if a portion of our own bulk and burden was stored
in its hold. We were amazed to find ourselves outside
still, with scarcely independent force enough to push
or pull effectually.

I have never insisted enough on the nakedness and
simplicity of friendship, the result of all emotions, their
subsidence, a fruit of the temperate zone. The friend
is an unrelated man, solitary and of distinct outline.

Must not our whole lives go unexplained, without
regard to us, notwithstanding a few flourishes of ours,

Yet a friend does not afford us cheap contrasts or
encounters. He forbears to ask explanations, but doubts
and surmises with full faith, as we silently ponder our
fates. He is vested with full powers, plenipotentiary,
all in all.

The hardest material obeys the same law with the

flowing from the atmosphere and emptying into the

The future reader of history will associate this generation
with the red man in his thoughts, and give it credit
for some sympathy with that race. Our history will
have some copper tints and reflections, at least, and be
read as through an Indian-summer haze; but such were
not our associations. But the Indian is absolutely forgotten
but by some persevering poets.
</p>

<p>
The white man has commenced a new era. What do
our anniversaries commemorate but white men's exploits?
For Indian deeds there must be an Indian memory;
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_444" name="Page_444" href="#Page_444">444</a></span>
the white man will remember his own only. We have
forgotten their hostility as well as friendship. Who can
realize that, within the memory of this generation, the
remnant of an ancient and dusky race of mortals called
the Stockbridge Indians, within the limits of this very
State, furnished a company for the war, on condition
only that they should not be expected to fight white
man's fashion, or to train, but Indian fashion. And
occasionally their wigwams are seen on the banks of this
very stream still, solitary and inobvious, like the cabins
of the muskrats in the meadows.
</p>

<p>
They seem like a race who have exhausted the secrets
of nature, tanned with age, while this young and
still fair Saxon slip, on whom the sun has not long shone,

For the Indian there is no safety but in the plow.
If he would not be pushed into the Pacific, he must
seize hold of a plow-tail and let go his bow and arrow,
his fish-spear and rifle. This the only Christianity that

His fate says sternly to him, "Forsake the hunter's
life and enter into the agricultural, the second, state of
man. Root yourselves a little deeper in the soil, if you
would continue to be the occupants of the country."
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_445" name="Page_445" href="#Page_445">445</a></span>
But I confess I have no little sympathy with the Indians
and hunter men. They seem to me a distinct and equally
respectable people, born to wander and to hunt, and
not to be inoculated with the twilight civilization of the
white man.
</p>

<p>
Father Le Jeune, a French missionary, affirmed
"that the Indians were superior in intellect to the
French peasantry of that time," and advised "that
laborers should be sent from France in order to work
for the Indians."
</p>

<p>
The Indian population within the present boundaries
of New Hampshire, Massachusetts, Rhode Island,
and Connecticut has been estimated not to have exceeded
40,000 "before the epidemic disease which
preceded the landing of the Pilgrims," and it was far
more dense here than elsewhere; yet they had no more
land than they wanted. The present white population
is more than 1,500,000 and two thirds of the land is
unimproved.
</p>

<p>
The Indian, perchance, has not made up his mind
to some things which the white man has consented to;
he has not, in all respects, stooped so low; and hence,
though he too loves food and warmth, he draws his
tattered blanket about him and follows his fathers,
rather than barter his birthright. He dies, and no doubt
his Genius judges well for him. But he is not worsted
in the fight; he is not destroyed. He only migrates
beyond the Pacific to more spacious and happier
hunting-grounds.
</p>

<p>
A race of hunters can never withstand the inroads
of a race of husbandmen. The latter burrow in the
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_446" name="Page_446" href="#Page_446">446</a></span>
night into their country and undermine them; and
[even] if the hunter is brave enough to resist, his game
is timid and has already fled. The rifle alone would never
exterminate it, but the plow is a more fatal weapon; it
wins the country inch by inch and holds all it gets.
</p>

<p>
What detained the Cherokees so long was the 2923
plows which that people possessed; and if they had
grasped their handles more firmly, they would never
have been driven beyond the Mississippi. No sense
of justice will ever restrain the farmer from plowing
up the land which is only hunted over by his neighbors.
No hunting-field was ever well fenced and surveyed
and its bounds accurately marked, unless it were an
English park. It is a property not held by the hunter
so much as by the game which roams it, and was never
well secured by warranty deeds. The farmer in his
treaties says only, or means only, "So far will I plow
this summer," for he has not seed corn enough to plant
more; but every summer the seed is grown which
plants a new strip of the forest.
</p>

<p>
The African will survive, for he is docile, and is
patiently learning his trade and dancing at his labor;
but the Indian does not often dance, unless it be the
war dance.

another's suspicion, we feel a strong impulse, even
when it is contrary to our nature, to do that which he

Gower writes like a man of common sense and good
parts who has undertaken with steady, rather than
high, purpose to do narrative with rhyme. With little
or no invention, following in the track of the old fablers,
he employs his leisure and his pen-craft to entertain
his readers and speak a good word for the right. He
has no fire, or rather blaze, though occasionally some
brand's end peeps out from the ashes, especially if
you approach the heap in a dark day, and if you extend
your hands over it you experience a slight warmth
there more than elsewhere. In fair weather you may
see a slight smoke go up here and there. He narrates
what Chaucer sometimes sings. He tells his story with
a fair understanding of the original, and sometimes it
gains a little in blunt plainness and in point in his hands.
Unlike the early Saxon and later English, his poetry is
but a plainer and directer speech than other men's
prose. He might have been a teamster and written his
rhymes on his wagon-seat as he went to mill with a
load of plaster.

<i>Oct. 21, 1842.</i> The atmosphere is so dry and transparent
and, as it were, inflammable at this season that
a candle in the grass shines white and dazzling, and
purer and brighter the farther off it is. Its heat seems
to have been extracted and only its harmless refulgent
light left. It is a star dropped down. The ancients were
more than poetically true when they called fire Vulcan's
flower. Light is somewhat almost moral. The most
intense—as the fixed stars and our own sun—has an
unquestionable preëminence among the elements. At

Among others I have picked up a curious spherical
stone, probably an implement of war, like a small
paving-stone about the size of a goose egg, with a groove
worn quite round it, by which it was probably fastened
to a thong or a withe and answered to strike a severe
blow like a shotted colt. I have since seen larger ones
of the same description.
</p>

<p>
These arrowheads are of every color and of various
forms and materials, though commonly made of a stone
which has a conchoidal fracture. Many small ones are
found, of white quartz, which are mere equilateral
triangles, with one side slightly convex. These were
probably small shot for birds and squirrels. The chips
which were made in their manufacture are also found
in large numbers wherever a lodge stood for any length
of time. And these slivers are the surest indication of
Indian ground, since the geologists tell us that this stone
is not to be found in this vicinity.
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_453" name="Page_453" href="#Page_453">453</a></span>
</p>
<p>
The spear-heads are of the same form and material
only larger.
</p>

<p>
Some are found as perfect and sharp as ever, for
time has not the effect of blunting them, but when they
break they have a ragged and cutting edge. Yet they
are so brittle that they can hardly be carried in the
pocket without being broken.
</p>

<p>
It is a matter of wonder how the Indians made even
those rude implements without iron or steel tools to
work with. It is doubtful whether one of our mechanics,
with all the aids of Yankee ingenuity, could soon learn
to copy one of the thousands under our feet. It is well
known the art of making flints with a cold chisel, as
practiced in Austria, requires long practice and knack
in the operator, but the arrowhead is of much more
irregular form, and, like the flint, such is the nature of
the stone, must be struck out by a succession of skillful
blows.
</p>

<p>
An Indian to whom I once exhibited some, but to
whom they were objects of as much curiosity as [to]
myself, suggested that, as white men have but one
blacksmith, so Indians had one arrowhead-maker for
many families. But there are the marks of too many
forges—unless they were like travelling cobblers—to
allow of this.
</p>

<p>
I have seen some arrowheads from the South Seas
which were precisely similar to those from here, so
necessary, so little whimsical is this little tool.
</p>

<p>
So has the steel hatchet its prototype in the stone one
of the Indian, as the stone hatchet in the necessities of
man.

The invention of that plow which now turns them
up to the surface marks the era of their burial. An
era which can never have its history, which is older than
history itself. These are relics of an era older than
modern civilization, compared with which Greece and
Rome and Egypt are modern. And still the savage
retreats and the white man advances.

I have the following account of some relics in my possession
which were brought from Taunton [?] in Bristol
County. A field which had been planted with corn for
many years. The sod being broken, the wind began
to blow away the soil and then the sand, for several
years, until at length it was blown away to the depth of
several feet, where it ceased, and the ground appeared
strewed with the remains of an Indian village, with regular
circles of stones which formed the foundation of
their wigwams, and numerous implements beside.

I am sometimes made aware of a kindness which
may have long since been shown, which surely memory
cannot retain, which reflects its light long after
its heat. I realize, my friend, that there have been times
when thy thoughts of me have been of such lofty kindness
that they passed over me like the winds of heaven
unnoticed, so pure that they presented no object to
my eyes, so generous and universal that I did not detect
them. Thou hast loved me for what I was not, but
for what I aspired to be. We shudder to think of the
kindness of our friend which has fallen on us cold,
though in some true but tardy hour we have awakened.
There has just reached me the kindness of some acts,
not to be forgotten, not to be remembered. I wipe off
these scores at midnight, at rare intervals, in moments
of insight and gratitude.

I am amused with the manner in which Quarles and
his contemporary poets speak of Nature,—with a sort
of gallantry, as a knight of his lady,—not as lovers,
but as having a thorough respect for her and some
title to her acquaintance. They speak manfully, and
their lips are not closed by affection.

What is called talking is a remarkable though I believe
universal phenomenon of human society. The
most constant phenomenon when men or women come
together is talking. A chemist might try this experiment
in his laboratory with certainty, and set down the fact
in his journal. This characteristic of the race may be
considered as established. No doubt every one can call
to mind numerous conclusive instances. Some nations,
it is true, are said to articulate more distinctly than
others; yet the rule holds with those who have the fewest
letters in their alphabet. Men cannot stay long together
without talking, according to the rules of polite
society. (As all men have two ears and but one tongue,
they must spend the extra and unavoidable hours of
silence in listening to the whisperings of genius, and
this fact it is that makes silence always respectable in
my eyes.) Not that they have anything to communicate,
or do anything quite natural or important to be
done so, but by common consent they fall to using the
invention of speech, and make a conversation, good or
bad. They say things, first this one and then that. They
express their "opinions," as they are called.
</p>

<p>
By a well-directed silence I have sometimes seen
threatening and troublesome people routed. You sit
musing as if you were in broad nature again. They
cannot stand it. Their position becomes more and
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_461" name="Page_461" href="#Page_461">461</a></span>
more uncomfortable every moment. So much humanity
over against one without any disguise,—not even
the disguise of speech! They cannot stand it nor sit
against it.
</p>

<p>
Not only must men talk, but for the most part must
talk about talk,—even about books, or dead and buried
talk. Sometimes my friend expects a few periods from
me. Is he exorbitant? He thinks it is my turn now.
Sometimes my companion thinks he has said a good
thing, but I don't see the difference. He looks just as he
did before. Well, it is no loss. I suppose he has plenty
more.
</p>

<p>
Then I have seen very near and intimate, very old
friends introduced by very old strangers, with liberty
given to talk. The stranger, who knows only the countersign,
says, "Jonas—Eldred," giving those names
which will make a title good in a court of law. (It may
be presumed that God does not know the Christian
names of men.) Then Jonas, like a ready soldier, makes
a remark,—a benediction on the weather it may be,—and
Eldred swiftly responds, and unburdens his breast,
and so the action begins. They bless God and nature
many times gratuitously, and part mutually well pleased,
leaving their cards. They did not happen to be present
at each other's christening.
</p>

<p>
Sometimes I have listened so attentively and with
so much interest to the whole expression of a man that
I did not hear one word he was saying, and saying too
with the more vivacity observing my attention.

<p>
But a man may be an object of interest to me though
his tongue is pulled out by the roots.

Scholars have for the most part a diseased way of
looking at the world. They mean by it a few cities and
unfortunate assemblies of men and women, who might
all be concealed in the grass of the prairies. They describe
this world as old or new, healthy or diseased,
according to the state of their libraries,—a little dust
more or less on their shelves. When I go abroad from
under this shingle or slate roof, I find several things
which they have not considered. Their conclusions

As with two eyes we see and with two ears we hear,
with the like advantage is man added to man. Making

of friendship. We never recognize each other as finite
and imperfect beings, but with a smile and as strangers.
My intercourse with men is governed by the same laws

I hold in my hands a recent volume of essays and
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_463" name="Page_463" href="#Page_463">463</a></span>
poems, in its outward aspect like the thousands which
the press sends forth, and, if the gods permitted their
own inspiration to be breathed in vain, this might be
forgotten in the mass, but the accents of truth are as
sure to be heard on earth as in heaven. The more I
read it the more I am impressed by its sincerity, its
depth and grandeur. It already seems ancient and has
lost the traces of its modern birth. It is an evidence of
many virtues in the writer. More serenely and humbly
confident, this man has listened to the inspiration which
all may hear, and with greater fidelity reported it. It is
therefore a true prophecy, and shall at length come to
pass. It has the grandeur of the Greek tragedy, or rather
its Hebrew original, yet it is not necessarily referred to
any form of faith. The slumbering, heavy depth of its
sentences is perhaps without recent parallel. It lies like
the sward in its native pasture, where its roots are never
disturbed, and not spread over a sandy embankment.

I hate museums; there is nothing so weighs upon my
spirits. They are the catacombs of nature. One green
bud of spring, one willow catkin, one faint trill from a

The life that is in a single green weed is of more worth

dead men. I know not whether I muse most at the

the traveller reposes on the grass? What right have
mortals to parade these things on their legs again, with

shall return to dust again, to return them to sawdust?

thus robbed of her dust. I have had my right-perceiving
senses so disturbed in these haunts as to mistake a veritable
living man for a stuffed specimen, and surveyed
him with dumb wonder as the strangest of the whole
collection. For the strangest is that which, being in
many particulars most like, is in some essential particular

It is one great and rare merit in the old English
tragedy that it says something. The words slide away
very fast, but toward some conclusion. It has to do with
things, and the reader feels as if he were advancing.
It does not make much odds what message the author
has to deliver at this distance of time, since no message
can startle us, but how he delivers it,—that it be
done in a downright and manly way. They come to

After all, we draw on very gradually in English literature
to Shakespeare, through Peele and Marlowe,
to say nothing of Raleigh and Spenser and Sidney. We
hear the same great tone already sounding to which
Shakespeare added a serener wisdom and clearer expression.
Its chief characteristics of reality and unaffected
manliness are there. The more we read of the
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_466" name="Page_466" href="#Page_466">466</a></span>
literature of those times, the more does acquaintance
divest the genius of Shakespeare of the in some measure

of by each other and the nation at large,—<i>Kit</i> Marlowe,

It is as far from pity as from contempt. I should
hesitate even to call it the highest sympathy, since the
word is of suspicious origin and suggests suffering rather

it records no apostasy or repentance, but there is a certain
divine and innocent and perennial health about it.

and loving men. It is not for the friend to be just even,—at
least he is not to be lost in this attribute,—but
to be only a large and free existence, representative
of humanity, its general court. Admirable to us as the

Yesterday I skated after a fox over the ice. Occasionally
he sat on his haunches and barked at me like
a young wolf. It made me think of the bear and her
cubs mentioned by Captain Parry, I think. All brutes
seem to have a genius for mystery, an Oriental aptitude
for symbols and the language of signs; and this is the
origin of Pilpay and Æsop. The fox manifested an
almost human suspicion of mystery in my actions.
While I skated directly after him, he cantered at the top
of his speed; but when I stood still, though his fear was
not abated, some strange but inflexible law of his nature
caused him to stop also, and sit again on his haunches.
While I still stood motionless, he would go slowly a rod
to one side, then sit and bark, then a rod to the other
side, and sit and bark again, but did not retreat, as if
spellbound. When, however, I commenced the pursuit
again, he found himself released from his durance.
</p>

<p>
Plainly the fox belongs to a different order of things
from that which reigns in the village. Our courts, though
they offer a bounty for his hide, and our pulpits, though
they draw many a moral from his cunning, are in few
senses contemporary with his free forest life.

It is the saddest thought of all, that what we are to
others, that we are much more to ourselves,—avaricious,
mean, irascible, affected,—we are the victims
of these faults. If our pride offends our humble neighbor,
much more does it offend ourselves, though our
lives are never so private and solitary.

If the Indian is somewhat of a stranger in nature,
the gardener is too much a familiar. There is something
vulgar and foul in the latter's closeness to his
mistress, something noble and cleanly in the former's
distance. Yet the hunter seems to have a property in
the moon which even the farmer has not. Ah! the poet
knows uses of plants which are not easily reported,
though he cultivates no parterre. See how the sun
smiles on him while he walks in the gardener's aisles,
rather than on the gardener.

Not only has the foreground of a picture its glass of
transparent crystal spread over it, but the picture itself
is a glass or transparent medium to a remoter background.
We demand only of all pictures that they be
perspicuous, that the laws of perspective have been
truly observed. It is not the fringed foreground of the
desert nor the intermediate oases that detain the eye
and the imagination, but the infinite, level, and roomy
horizon, where the sky meets the sand, and heavens and
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_474" name="Page_474" href="#Page_474">474</a></span>

into which leads the path of the pilgrim.

All things are in revolution; it is the one law of nature
by which order is preserved, and time itself lapses
and is measured. Yet some things men will do from
age to age, and some things they will not do.

<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_475" name="Page_475" href="#Page_475">475</a></span>
in this water! And it will not be forgotten by some
memory that we <i>were</i> contemporaries. It is of <i>some</i>
import. We shall be some time friends, I trust, and
know each other better. Distrust is too prevalent now.
We are so much alike! have so many faculties in common!
I have not yet met with the philosopher who could,
in a quite conclusive, undoubtful way, show me <i>the</i>,
and, if not <i>the</i>, then how <i>any</i>, difference between man
and a fish. We are so much alike! How much could
a really tolerant, patient, humane, and truly great and
natural man make of them, if he should try? For they
are to be understood, surely, as all things else, by no
other method than that of sympathy. It is easy to say
what they are not to us, <i>i. e.</i>, what we are not to them;
but what we might and ought to be is another affair.

We read Marlowe as so much poetical pabulum. It
is food for poets, water from the Castalian Spring,
some of the atmosphere of Parnassus, raw and crude
indeed, and at times breezy, but pure and bracing.
Few have so rich a phrase! He had drunk deep of the
Pierian Spring, though not deep enough, and had that
fine madness, as Drayton says,

We read his "Dr. Faustus," "Dido, Queen of Carthage,"
and "Hero and Leander," especially the last,
without being wearied. He had many of the qualities
of a great poet, and was in some degree worthy to precede
Shakespeare. But he seems to have run to waste
for want of seclusion and solitude, as if mere pause and
deliberation would have added a new element of greatness
to his poetry. In his unquestionably fine, heroic
tone it would seem as if he had the rarest part of genius,
and education could have added the rest. The "Hero

We can afford to lend a willing ear occasionally to

three-foot lath that dangles by your side, or those brazen-mouthed
pieces under the burying hill which the trainers

Do our protectors burrow under the burying-ground hill,
on the edge of the bean-field which you all know,
gorging themselves once a year with powder and smoke,
and kept bright and in condition by a chafing of oiled
rags and rotten stone? Have we resigned the protection

the dispersed and mutilated members though it were

It is a marvel how the birds contrive to survive in
this world. These tender sparrows that flit from bush
to bush this evening, though it is so late, do not seem
improvident, [but appear] to have found a roost for the
night. They must succeed by weakness and reliance,
for they are not bold and enterprising, as their mode
of life would seem to require, but very weak and tender
creatures. I have seen a little chipping sparrow, come
too early in the spring, shivering on an apple twig,
drawing in its head and striving to warm it in its muffled
feathers; and it had no voice to intercede with nature,
but peeped as helpless as an infant, and was ready
to yield up its spirit and die without any effort. And yet
this was no new spring in the revolution of the seasons.

Our offense is rank, it smells to heaven. In the midst
of our village, as in most villages, there is a slaughterhouse,
and throughout the summer months, day and
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_481" name="Page_481" href="#Page_481">481</a></span>
night, to the distance of half a mile, which embraces
the greater part of the village, the air [is] filled with such
scents as we instinctively avoid in a woodland walk;
and doubtless, if our senses were once purified and
educated by a simpler and truer life, we should not consent
to live in such a neighborhood.
</p>

<p class="p2">
George Melvin, our Concord trapper, told me that
in going to the spring near his house, where he kept his
minnows for bait, he found that they were all gone,
and immediately suspected that a mink had got them;
so he removed the snow all around and laid open the
trail of a mink underneath, which he traced to his hole,
where were the fragments of his booty. There he set
his trap, and baited it with fresh minnows. Going again
soon to the spot, he found one of the mink's fore legs
in the trap gnawed off near the body, and, having set
it again, he caught the mink with his three legs, the
fourth having only a short bare bone sticking out.
</p>

<p>
When I expressed some surprise at this, and said that
I heard of such things but did not know whether to
believe them, and was now glad to have the story confirmed,
said he: "Oh, the muskrats are the greatest
fellows to gnaw their legs off. Why I caught one once
that had just gnawed his third leg off, this being the
third time he had been trapped; and he lay dead by the
trap, for he couldn't run on one leg." Such tragedies
are enacted even in this sphere and along our peaceful
streams, and dignify at least the hunter's trade. Only
courage does anywhere prolong life, whether of man or
beast.
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_482" name="Page_482" href="#Page_482">482</a></span>
</p>
<p>
When they are caught by the leg and cannot get into
the water to drown themselves, they very frequently
gnaw the limb off. They are commonly caught under
water or close to the edge, and dive immediately with the
trap and go to gnawing and are quackled and drowned
in a moment, though under other circumstances they
will live several minutes under water. They prefer
to gnaw off a fore leg to a hind leg, and do not gnaw
off their tails. He says the wharf rats are very common
on the river and will swim and cross it like a muskrat,
and will gnaw their legs and even their tails off in the
trap.
</p>

<p>
These would be times that tried men's souls, if men
had souls to be tried; aye, and the souls of brutes, for
they must have souls as well as teeth. Even the water-rats
lead sleepless nights and live Achillean lives. There
are the strong will and the endeavor. Man, even the
hunter, naturally has sympathy with every brave effort,
even in his game, to maintain that life it enjoys. The
hunter regards with awe his game, and it becomes at
last his medicine.<a name='FA_507' id='FA_507' href='#FN_507' class='fnanchor'>[507]</a>

Carlyle's works are not to be studied,—hardly re-read.
Their first impression is the truest and the deepest.
There is no reprint. If you look again, you will be disappointed

have excited. They are true natural products in this
respect. All things are but once, and never repeated.
The first faint blushes of the morning gilding the mountain-tops,
with the pale phosphorus and saffron-colored
clouds,—they verily transport us to the morning of
creation; but what avails it to travel eastward, or look
again there an hour hence. We should be as far in the
day ourselves, mounting toward our meridian. There is
no <i>double entendre</i> for the alert reader; in fact the work
was designed for such complete success that it serves
but for a single occasion. It is the luxury of wealth and
art when for every deed its own instrument is manufactured.
The knife which sliced the bread of Jove

a greater miracle take place than if we should look
through each other's eyes for an instant? We should
live in all the ages of the world in an hour,—aye, in all
the worlds of the ages. What I have read of rhapsodists,
of the primitive poets, Argonautic expeditions, the life
of demigods and heroes, Eleusinian mysteries, etc., suggests
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_484" name="Page_484" href="#Page_484">484</a></span>

would be.

I require of any lecturer that he will read me a more
or less simple and sincere account of his own life, of what
he has done and thought,—not so much what he has
read or heard of other men's lives and actions, but some
such account as he would send to his kindred from a distant
land,—and if he has lived sincerely, it must have
been in a distant land to me,—describing even his outward
circumstances and what adventures he has had, as
well as his thoughts and feelings about them. He who
gives us only the results of other men's lives, though with
brilliant temporary success, we may in some measure
justly accuse of having defrauded us of our time. We
want him to give us that which was most precious to
him,—not his life's blood but even that for which his
life's blood circulated, what he has got by living. If
anything ever yielded him pure pleasure or instruction,
let him communicate it. Let the money-getter tell us
how much he loves wealth, and what means he takes
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_485" name="Page_485" href="#Page_485">485</a></span>
to accumulate it. He must describe those facts which
he knows and loves better than anybody else. He
must not write on foreign missions. The mechanic will
naturally lecture about his trade, the farmer about his
farm, and every man about that which he, compared
with other men, knows best. Yet incredible mistakes
are made. I have heard an owl lecture with perverse
show of learning upon the solar microscope, and chanticleer
upon nebulous stars, when both ought to have
been sound asleep, the one in a hollow tree, the other
on his roost.

After I lectured here before, this winter, I heard that
some of my townsmen had expected of me some account
of my life at the pond. This I will endeavor to
give to-night.

I know a robust and hearty mother who thinks that
her son, who died abroad, came to his end by living too

Men are not inclined to leave off hanging men to-day,

Concord this winter which would have starved, if it
had not been for potatoes—and tea and coffee.

It has not been my design to live cheaply, but only to
live as I could, not devoting much time to getting a
living. I made the most of what means were already
got.

To determine the character of our life and how adequate
it is to its occasion, just try it by any test, as for
instance that this same sun is seen in Europe and in
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_486" name="Page_486" href="#Page_486">486</a></span>
America at the same time, that these same stars are
visible in twenty-four hours to two thirds the inhabitants
of the globe, and who knows how many and
various inhabitants of the universe. What farmer in
his field lives according even to this somewhat trivial
material fact.
</p>

I just looked up at a fine twinkling star and thought
that a voyager whom I know, now many days' sail from
this coast, might possibly be looking up at that same
star with me. The stars are the apexes of what triangles!
There is always the possibility—the possibility,
I say—of being <i>all</i>, or remaining a particle, in
the universe.

In these days and in this country, a few implements,
as the axe, shovel, etc., and, to the studious, light and
stationery and access to a few books, will rank next to
necessaries, but can all be obtained at a very trifling
cost. Under the head of clothing is to be ranked bedding,
or night-clothes.

We are very anxious to keep the animal heat in us.
What pains we take with our beds! robbing the nests

The complete subjugation of the body to the mind
prophesies the sovereignty of the latter over the whole
of nature. The instincts are to a certain extent a sort
of independent nobility, of equal date with the mind, or
crown,—ancient dukes and princes of the regal blood.
They are perhaps the mind of our ancestors subsided
in us, the experience of the race.

A small sum would really do much good, if the donor
spent himself with it and did not merely relinquish it to
some distant society whose managers do the good or the
evil with it. How much might be done for this town
with a hundred dollars! I could provide a select course
of lectures for the summer or winter with that sum,
which would be an incalculable benefit to every inhabitant.
With a thousand dollars I could purchase
for this town a more complete and select library than
exists in the State out of Cambridge and Boston, perhaps
a more available one than any. Men sit palsied

Men talk much of coöperation nowadays, of working
together to some worthy end; but what little coöperation
there is, is as if it were not, being a simple
result of which the means are hidden, a harmony inaudible
to men. If a man has faith, he will coöperate
with equal faith everywhere. If he has not faith he will
continue to live like the rest of the world, whatever company
he is joined to. To coöperate thoroughly implies
to get your living together. I heard it proposed lately
that two young men should travel together over the
world, the one earning his means as he went, the other
carrying a bill of exchange in his pocket. It was easy
to see that they could not long be companions, or coöperate,
since one would not operate at all. They would
part company at the first and most interesting crisis
in their adventures.

FOOTNOTES

<p class='footnote' id='FN_1'>
<span class='fnlabel'><a href='#FA_1'>[1]</a></span> In many cases the punctuation seems to be absolutely without significance;
as if the writer had simply fallen into the habit of dropping
dashes in an absent-minded way as he passed along. The following
examples (the longest an extreme case) will show what is meant:—</p>

<p class="footnote">
"I heard from time to time—a new note."
</p>

<p class="footnote">
"The <i>Equisetum sylvaticum</i>—there is now of a reddish cast."
</p>

<p class="footnote">
"It is very difficult—to find a suitable place to camp near the
road—affording—water—a good—prospect and retirement."

like to know the birds of the woods better. What birds inhabit our
woods? I hear their various notes ringing through them. What
musicians compose our woodland quire? They must be forever
strange and interesting to me." Even the glass that he finally
bought was not an opera-glass, but a "spy-glass" (monocular) so
called, and must have been of comparatively little help in the identification
of woodland species.

coward substitutes for this thrilling sphere music a universal wail, for
this melodious chant a nasal cant, and but whistles to keep his courage
up. He blows a feeble blast of slender melody and can compel his
neighborhood only into a partial concord with himself, because nature
has but little sympathy with such a soul. Hence he hears no accordant
note in the universe, and is a coward, or consciously outcast
and deserted man. But the brave man, without drum or trumpet,
compels concord everywhere by the universality and tunefulness of his
soul.

Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions will
be renamed.

Creating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright
law means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,
so the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United
States without permission and without paying copyright
royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works to protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm
concept and trademark. Project Gutenberg is a registered trademark,
and may not be used if you charge for the eBooks, unless you receive
specific permission. If you do not charge anything for copies of this
eBook, complying with the rules is very easy. You may use this eBook
for nearly any purpose such as creation of derivative works, reports,
performances and research. They may be modified and printed and given
away--you may do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks
not protected by U.S. copyright law. Redistribution is subject to the
trademark license, especially commercial redistribution.

START: FULL LICENSE

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full
Project Gutenberg-tm License available with this file or online at
www.gutenberg.org/license.

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works

1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the
person or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph
1.E.8.

1.B. "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the
Foundation" or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg-tm License when
you share it without charge with others.

1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg-tm work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country outside the United States.

1.E. Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1. The following sentence, with active links to, or other
immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work
on which the phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

  This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and
  most other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no
  restrictions whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it
  under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included with this
  eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org. If you are not located in the
  United States, you'll have to check the laws of the country where you
  are located before using this ebook.

1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.3. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the
beginning of this work.

1.E.4. Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5. Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6. You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including
any word processing or hypertext form. However, if you provide access
to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format
other than "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original "Plain
Vanilla ASCII" or other form. Any alternate format must include the
full Project Gutenberg-tm License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7. Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8. You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
provided that

* You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
  the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
  you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
  to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he has
  agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
  within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
  legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty
  payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in
  Section 4, "Information about donations to the Project Gutenberg
  Literary Archive Foundation."

* You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
  you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.

* You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
  any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
  electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days of
  receipt of the work.

* You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
  distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9. If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work or group of works on different terms than
are set forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing
from both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and The
Project Gutenberg Trademark LLC, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark. Contact the Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT
LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in
accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org



Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation

The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit
501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal
Revenue Service. The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification
number is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
